#### [On the sex chromatin and sex chromatin-like nuclear structures in human Purkinje-cells].

BACKGROUND 				Animal experiments have shown that in the course of chromatolysis the nuclear sex chromatin of nerve cells of female mammals changes its customary location at the nucleolus and migrates to the nuclear membrane; moreover, in the nuclei of nerve cells of males there occur under similar conditions nuclear structures which resemble the sex chromatin.
BACKGROUND 				It was, therefore, thought of interest to see if similar findings also apply to human Purkinje-cells.
METHODS    				The cerebellum of 100 female and 52 male corpses of various ages was examined.
METHODS    				Paraffin sections, 2-5 mum thick, were stained with haemalumeosin and, after hydrolysis by hydrochloric acid, with cresyl violet of Schiff's reagent (Feulgen stain).
METHODS    				In each cerebellum 100 Purkinje-cells, whose nuclei showed a well developed nucleolus and an obvious Barr body, were studied.
METHODS    				In the cerebellum of 29 female corpses the cells examined showed a marked cytoplasmic chromatolysis; in the Purkinje-cells of the remaining 71 female, and of all the male corpses the stage of chromatolysis was classified according to the degree of dissolution of the Nissl bodies as "feeble", "marked", or as the stage of restitution, characterized by nuclear caps.
RESULTS    				The sex chromatin was seen as a, mainly, round and compact chromocenter with a maximal diameter of 0.6--1.6 mum.
RESULTS    				The larger Barr bodies were seen more frequently, if chromatolysis in the corresponding cells was marked.
RESULTS    				With increasing chromatolysis the Barr body, which usually occupies a perinucleolar location, tended to be found more often at or near the nuclear membrane.
RESULTS    				In the cerebellum of the males 17.4% of the Purkinje cells studied showed heteropyknotic nuclear structures which could not always be distinguished in size or in appearance from a sex chromatin.
RESULTS    				They occupied predominantly a perinuclear position.
RESULTS    				but with increasing chromatolysis they too were seen more frequently in a location which tended to be intermediary or near the nuclear membrane.
RESULTS    				Not infrequently the nuclei simultaneously presented a granular hyperchromatosis.
CONCLUSIONS				The change in the location of the sex chromatin in the nucleus is considered to be associated with compensatory processes following chromatolysis.
CONCLUSIONS				These in turn are accompanied by an intranuclear current of materials, such as RNA, towards the periphery of the nucleus, or by changed electric potentials which develop in the affected cells.
CONCLUSIONS				The variations in size of the Barr body should be attributed to a variable condensation of the corresponding X-chromosome, rather than to polyploidy of the nerve cell nuclei.
CONCLUSIONS				The sex chromatin-like chromocenters, which are seen in "male" Purkinje-cells in the course of chromatolysis, could be attributed to certain chromosomal segments which have a tendency to heterochromasia...

#### [Necroses in the granular cell layer of the cerebellum due to methylchloride intoxication in guinea pigs (author's transl)].

OBJECTIVE  				Neurotoxic action of methylchloride was reported by various authors.
OBJECTIVE  				As this solvent is widely used in chemical industry the morphological changes in the CNS of guinea pigs due to methylchloride intoxication were comparatively studied by light- and electron-microscopy.
METHODS    				19 guinea pigs of both sexes (body weight 300-600 g) were individually exposed to inhalation of methylchloride mixed to normal breathed air in a 2 Vol.-% amount in a pressurised vessel of 20,000 cm3 volume (details on the experimental arrangement see VOLK 1973) for each 10 min 6 times a week.
METHODS    				3 control animals were fed like the experimental animals and exposed to normal breathing air for the same time in the pressurised vessel.
METHODS    				The experimental period varied between 7 and 70 days, the number of inhalations was between 6 and 61.
METHODS    				At the end of the experiment the animals were sacrificed by perfusion with 3% buffered glutaraldehyde under Thiogenal anesthesia.
METHODS    				For light microscopy paraffin sections were prepared from tissue samples of the cerebrum, cerebellum, brain stem, mesencephalon, spinal medulla and spinal ganglia (stainings: HE; Turnbull's blue; Nissl; Klüver-Barrera; Mallory; Bodian and Kossa).
METHODS    				For electron microscopy tissue blocks of the cortex, corpus callosum, striatum, mesencephalon and cerebellum as well as of spinal medulla and spinal ganglia were postfixed in 1% OsO4 and embedded in Araldit in the common way.
RESULTS    				Clinical observations--9 animals showed normal behaviour after 32 inhalations in 37 days.--6 animals displayed staggering, atactic moving of the head, retardation in spontaneous reactions and mobility.
RESULTS    				Ataxia and paresis of the hind legs occurred earliest after 17 inhalations.
RESULTS    				4 animals showed all these symptoms only after 25 days.
RESULTS    				Morphological findings: Macroscopy: Occurrence of necroses in the cerebellar cortex was mainly observed in the lower part of the vermis; pressings of tissue in the occipital foramen, tissue swellings around the aqueduct and consecutive enlargement of the lateral ventricles occurred.
RESULTS    				Light microscopy: Changes in the Stratum granulosum in the lower part of the vermis as pyknosis of the cell nuclei and hydropic swelling of the cytoplasm (fig.
RESULTS    				1a) were seen after 10 days.
RESULTS    				Focal necroses of the granular layer as well as "Status spongiosus" and edema occurred after 21 days (fig.
RESULTS    				1b).
RESULTS    				In later phases these alterations were also present in other regions of the vermis and of the cerebellum, too.
RESULTS    				Furthermore, edema of the Lamina dissecans, hydropic swelling of the Bergmann's glia and marked edematous transformation of the molecular layer were observed.
RESULTS    				In this phase the hitherto intact Purkinje cells responded to the intoxication by homogenization of the cytoplasm and cell necroses.
RESULTS    				Electron microscopy: Initially an increase in density of the nuclear chromatin of the granular cells was observed associated with formation of homogeneous electron dense chromatin fragments which were finally released to the perikaryon (figs.
RESULTS    				2a, 2b)...

#### [Analysis of DNA histograms by computer (author's transl)].

BACKGROUND 				Quantitative DNA cytophotometry, the study of morphology of chromosomes and cell kinetics are important approaches toward characterization of genetic information.
BACKGROUND 				Each approach has its own problems and limits.
BACKGROUND 				Difficulties with interpretation of DNA histograms arise from a lack of proper terminology, and from attempting to interpret them in terms of the existing terminologies for chromosomal analysis and cell kinetics.
BACKGROUND 				Aim of this research was to develop a computerized mathematical analysis of DNA histograms.
METHODS    				As a basis for the comparison of normal with those of tumor cell populations the DNA histograms of heart muscle cells were selected for the normal cell population from 14 normal hearts of adults, 16 hypertrophic hearts, 14 non-polyploidized hearts of children, and 14 hypertrophic hearts of children with congenital malformations.
METHODS    				Normal diploid cell populations from 7 effusions were also included.
METHODS    				The 24 populations of malignant cells consisted of primary tumors and metastatic effusions.
METHODS    				DNA cytophotometry was performed on single nuclei in Feulgen stained preparations by means of the UMSP/XD 50 ZEISS.
METHODS    				The approximation of the DNA histograms by linear combination of normal distributions was done according to spline-function and calculated by means of the IBM-375.
RESULTS    				The nuclear classes 2C, 4C, and 8C show no differences between the normal, left and right heart with respect to mean values (X), standard deviations (sx), variances (sX) and coefficients of variance (sx/X).
RESULTS    				However, coefficients of variance are smaller in hypertrophic (2.15 to 8.37%) than in normal hearts of adults (8.90 to 10.85%), and larger in hypertrophic heart of children (4.06 to 7.09%).
RESULTS    				The mean values of the DNA classes 2C, 4C, 8C, and 16C vary witin +/- 18.6% with a probability of 95.5%.
RESULTS    				Benign effusions contain only 2C and 4C nuclei with a variance of 4.00% and 8.75%, respectively.
RESULTS    				In DNA histograms of malignant cells, only one third has a first peak outside of 2C +/- 18.6%.
RESULTS    				In approximately one fifth of the histrograms the position of the second or third peaks deviates significantly from normal polyploid values.
RESULTS    				Since a large proportion of polyploid nuclei is limited to only a few normal tissues, pronounced polyploidy is suggestive of malignancy in all other tissues.
RESULTS    				If in the cases containing only two DNA classes, 2C and 4C, the populations are malignant, the proportion of 4C is more than 8% while in the corresponding benign populations the proportion of 4C atains only 2.97 +/- 2.5%.
RESULTS    				In some cases a few highly polyploidized nuclei not taken into a account by our computer program are suggestive of malignancy.
RESULTS    				In only one DNA histogram out of the 24 analysed, all of these criteria are negative.
RESULTS    				In six cases the computer analyses reveal two stemlines of tumor cells with corresponding polyploid values.

#### Biological age and habitual physical activity in relation to physical fitness in 12- and 13-year-old schoolboys.

OBJECTIVE  				The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between biological age, habitual physical activity and anthropometrical and physiological characteristics in 12- and 13-year-old schoolboys (n = 70).
METHODS    				At the beginning and the end of the school year 1971/2 biological age was determined by measuring skeletal age from left hand X-ray photographs.
METHODS    				Habitual physical activity was determined by questionnaire interview and pedometers.
RESULTS    				All anthropometrical characteristics showed significant correlations (P less than 0.05) with skeletal age except for bicipital and tricipital skinfolds.
RESULTS    				Out of 9 physical fitness tests handgrip was the only test that showed a significant correlation (0.52) with skeletal age.
RESULTS    				Pedometer scores gave significant negative correlations (P less than 0.05) with anthropometrical characteristics except for tricipital skinfold.
RESULTS    				The fitness tests bent arm hang, 12 min run walk, sit and reach and W-170 showed significant correlations (P less than 0.05) with pedometer scores.

#### [The fructose induced "glycogenosis". II. Histochemical studies of glycogen metabolism in rat liver after fructose overload and similar diets (author's transl)].

BACKGROUND 				Feeding of fructose for 7 days has been morphometrically shown to induce a SER-reduction and an accumulation of glycogen in rat liver cells.
BACKGROUND 				This hypothetical model "glycogenosis" is investigated with histochemical methods.
METHODS    				Rats are given a solution of 60% fructose in water as only nutritional source.
METHODS    				Controls are given a solution of 60% glucose in water, an isocaloric Altromin-R-standard diet and an Altromin-R-standard diet ad libitum.
METHODS    				Reversion of fructose induced metabolic changes is investigated by a 7 days fructose diet followed by an 1-4 days Altromin-R-standard diet ad libitum.
METHODS    				Glycogen and glycogen metabolizing enzymes are demonstrated after a 7 days diet and in the course of an 1-7 days fructose diet.
RESULTS    				Feeding of fructose leads to a high glycogen content, combined with a high activity of glycogen-phosphorylase and glucose-6-phosphatase in the liver parenchyma.
RESULTS    				Glycogen-synthetase activity increases during the first 4 days and then it drops to a low level.
RESULTS    				A pathological alteration of liver cell metabolism seems to be improbable, for all fructose induced changes are reversibel after 2 days of Altromin-R-standard diet.
RESULTS    				Glucose-6-phosphatase, as a marker-enzyme of the smooth endoplasmatic reticulum, is discussed to become activated by disruption of SER membranes due to fructose.

#### [Needle biopsy in gout and pseudogout (author's transl)].

BACKGROUND 				Radiological and morphological findings in advanced arthritis urica and pyrophosphate arthropathy are well known.
BACKGROUND 				In contrast, the early changes of synovial membrane in these disturbances of metabolism pose diagnostic problems.
BACKGROUND 				With the assistance of various cytological techniques and polarizing microscopical as well as electron microscopical investigation it was examined to what extent needle biopsies can be helpful in the differential diagnosis of gout and pseudogout.
METHODS    				In 8 patients with gout and 11 patients with pseudogout synovial fluid and small tissue specimens could be obtained with the aid of the Parker-Pearson needle.
METHODS    				Both fluid and tissue specimens were investigated light and electron microscopically.
METHODS    				Cell counts were evaluated in a Rosenthal chamber.
METHODS    				The differentiation of the cells in stained smears was done by counting 200-600 cells per case.
METHODS    				Crystals were identified by polarizing microscopy in wet preparations of freshly aspirated synovial fluid.
RESULTS    				Polarizing microscopy of synovial fluid detected intra- as well as extracellular urate and pyrophosphate crystals.
RESULTS    				The wedge-shaped urate crystals and the larger partly polygonal pyrophosphate crystals showed different polarizing microscopical properties and a negative birefringence.
RESULTS    				The absolute cell counts in gout were higher than those in pseudogout.
RESULTS    				The relative cell counts of the different cell types in synovial fluid showed more variation in gout than in pseudogout.
RESULTS    				Cases with acute gout developed a relative leukocytosis in contrast to a relative lymphocytosis in chronic gout.
RESULTS    				A relative leukocytosis was constant in all patients with pseudogout.
RESULTS    				Sclerosed areas with scarce and plump villi as well as sometimes hyperplastic and polymorphous synovial cell layers could be demonstrated histologically in the tissue specimens of the needle biopsies in cases with gout.
RESULTS    				Urate crystals were less frequent in specimens fixed in formalin.
RESULTS    				The histological alterations in pseudogout were uniform, 2-4 rows of slightly pleomorphic synovial cells lined the inner surface of the joint capsule, sclerosing alterations were less frequent.
RESULTS    				Pyrophosphate crystals and calcified particles were seen within the synovial lining cells, the connective tissue and the enodthelial cells of the blood vessels in pseudogout specimens.
RESULTS    				Intra- as well as extracellular crystals could also be demonstrated with the aid of scanning electron microscopy in sediments of synovial fluid in gout and pseudogout.
RESULTS    				Transmission electron microscopical investigations of synovial tissue specimens detected proliferated and pleomorphic synovial lining cells in gout in contrast to a more monomorphic appearance of these cells in pseudogout.
RESULTS    				The crystals were washed out during the preparation techniques for transmission electron microscopy so that needle-like empty spaces resulted within cytoplasm of the phagocytic cells.
RESULTS    				These clefts were surrounded by phagosomal structures and densified cytoplasmic ground substance; sometimes they were also lined by membranes...

#### [Virus-induced autoimmunity phenomena in experimental animals (author's transl)].

OBJECTIVE  				It may happen that the virus infection causes changes of the immunogenicity of the host cells that may theoretically result in disturbances of the "self-recognition" of the organism.
OBJECTIVE  				In this paper we report on the immunization of rabbits by autologous testes cells infected with herpes-virus hominis (HVH) types 1 and 2.
METHODS    				In 20 rabbits the excision of one testis was carried out.
METHODS    				The testes cells were cultivated in L 15-medium (Leibowitz) and lactalbumine hydrolysate supplemented with 12% autologous serum.
METHODS    				The virus strains herpesvirus hominis type 1 (Kupka) and type 2 (US) were passaged three times on autologous testes cells, in order to remove host-foreign proteins out of the envelope.
METHODS    				Thereafter, the monolayer cultures grown in Demeter flasks were infected with 15 ml virus suspension containing 10(4) to 10(5) TCID50.
METHODS    				For the immunization three antigen preparations were applied: a) Supernatant of virus-infected cell cultures, b) Pellets of the virus-infected cell cultures, c) Pellets of the non-infected cell cultures.
METHODS    				Two times at an interval of 3 weeks the animals were immunized by intramuscular and intraperitoneal injections with prepared antigens.
METHODS    				Altogether, 20 animals were immunized: 15 rabbits with virus antigen, 5 control animals with non-infected autologous cells.
METHODS    				After 28 days, 13 rabbits were bled, the second testis, liver, spleen, and kidneys were taken out.
METHODS    				From 7 rabbits, only the second testis was taken out.
METHODS    				These animals got a further injection on the 40th day post infectionem, and on the 50th day, they were bled.
METHODS    				From the tissue samples, frozen sections were cut, fixed with acetone, and treated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled antirabbit globulin, in order to elicite the tissue-bound antibodies.
METHODS    				For histological studies, paraffin sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and with azan, besides the PAS reaction was carried out.
METHODS    				The determination of humoral antibodies was done by means of indirect-immunofluorescence antibody technique (IFAT).
METHODS    				As antigen, autologous cells grown on slides were used; a part of them was infected with HVH types 1 or 2, while another part was not infected.
RESULTS    				After immunization with autologous testes cells which were infected with HVH types 1 or 2, histologically homogeneous eosinophilic PAS-positive substances were detected in 14 out of 15 rabbits, mainly in the interstitium of the testes (fig.
RESULTS    				2).
RESULTS    				These substances corresponded to globulin deposits that could be demonstrated by the reaction of labelled antirabbit globulin (fig.
RESULTS    				1).
RESULTS    				The testes sections of thoses 5 rabbits that were injected with noninfected autologous cells, did not react.
RESULTS    				On the 28th day post infectionem, the antibody levels against virus antigen were found at the degree of 1:32 to 1:1024.
RESULTS    				Only after the removal of the second testis, there occurred antibodies against autologous testes cells.
RESULTS    				The immunization conditions exclude the formation of isoantibodies...

#### [The fructose induces "glycogenosis". III. Histochemical and morphometrical studies of glycogen metabolism in mouse liver after fructose overload (author's transl)].

BACKGROUND 				After feeding fructose for 7 days rat liver cells show an accumulation of glycogen, a high activity of glucose-6-phosphatase combined with a SER- and RER-reduction.
BACKGROUND 				This result was reviewed by mouse liver cells using histochemical and morphometrical methods.
METHODS    				60% fructose in drinking water was given mice as only nutritional source.
METHODS    				Controls had free access to Altromin-R-standard diet and drinking water.
METHODS    				Glycogen and glycogen metabolizing enzymes are demonstrated in the course of an 1-14 days fructose diet.
METHODS    				After a 7 days diet liver tissue was analysed morphometrically.
RESULTS    				Feeding of fructose leads to a high glycogen content, combined with a high activity of glycogen-phosphorylase and glucose-6-phosphatase in the liver parenchyma of mouse.
RESULTS    				Glycogen-synthetase activity falls to a low level.
RESULTS    				The SER and RER and the peroxisomes are reduced.
RESULTS    				The single volume of the hepatic nucleus is decreased and the hepatocellular chondrioma is transformed in a smaller number of larger mitochondria.
RESULTS    				Compared with the rate the analysed organelles and enzymes of mouse liver show only slight quantitative differences.
RESULTS    				The increase of glucose-6-phosphatase and simultaneous reduction of endoplasmic reticulum-membranes is illustrated by the dynamic structure of endoplasmic reticulum-membranes, which adapt to metabolic changes.
RESULTS    				The variable turnover of different parts of endoplasmic reticulum-membranes seems to be very important.

#### Does history-taking affect learning of attitudes?

OBJECTIVE  				How can medical students adopt a patient-oriented approach?
METHODS    				During the past 7 years approximately 60 preclinical and clinical students joined dynamically oriented group sessions on medical history-taking.
METHODS    				An open-ended question technique was used.
RESULTS    				The student's expectations of the patient were monitored by the repertory grid technique using a self-developed dyad grid form which allowed the estimation of reciprocal expectations as seen by the student.
RESULTS    				A main component analysis of the ratings obtained was performed.
RESULTS    				The development in one group was taken as representative of the general development in the different groups.
RESULTS    				Two main components (MC I, II) were found to account for approximately 40 and 25% of the total variance (distance/empathy and dominance/dependence).
RESULTS    				The student's main concern is centered on the problem of dependence, MC II.
RESULTS    				He expects the patient to cling to him.
RESULTS    				Similarly he feels dependent on the psychosomatic lecturer.
RESULTS    				He feels as though he is the lecturer's patient.
RESULTS    				During group work the patient is seen to be less clinging.
RESULTS    				The student learns that he is not his lecturer's patient but his junior partner.
RESULTS    				He changes his professional ego-ideal as a future doctor.
RESULTS    				This is modelled according to his own relationship with the lecturer.
RESULTS    				It is not modelled according to the usual doctor-patient relationship as perceived by the student.
RESULTS    				The main characteristic of the change is a lessening of dependency needs as felt in the relationship to the patient.
CONCLUSIONS				The findings are interpreted as an attitudinal change in favour of a more patient-oriented attitude.
CONCLUSIONS				The change was affected through confrontation with the patient's needs.
CONCLUSIONS				Conclusions were drawn: The student has to be trained how to cope with dependency needs.
CONCLUSIONS				Special learning settings have to be provided which are staffed with patient-oriented physicians.

#### [The cytologic differentiation of prostatis (author's transl)].

BACKGROUND 				Cytologists are often confronted with unexpected prostatitis in aspiration biopsy smears, because clinically prostatitis may lead to suspicious induration of the prostate similar to carcinoma and therefore subject to diagnostic biopsy.
BACKGROUND 				The question is whether cytodiagnosis is a reliable method for the exact morphologic diagnosis of prostatitis.
BACKGROUND 				The following paper attempts to answer this question.
METHODS    				The basis of our cytologic differentiation of prostatitis was a series of 129 cases of prostatitis in 664 aspiration biopsies according to Franzén.
METHODS    				In 82 of these 129 cases, we had simultaneously performed a transrectal needle punch biopsy, which allowed a diagnostic comparison between the cytologic and histologic diagnosis with special reference to the reliability of cytology.
METHODS    				Epithelial atypias were classified into 4 grades: Grade 1: No atypia; Grade 2: Slight atypia; Grade 3: Marked atypia; Grade 4: Malignant epithelium.
METHODS    				Cytomorphologic characteristics of each grade are described.
RESULTS    				We found 6 different types in 4 main groups of prostatitis: 1.
RESULTS    				Acute prostatitis, purulent and abscessing types.
RESULTS    				2.
RESULTS    				Chronic prostatitis.
RESULTS    				3.
RESULTS    				Chronic relapsing prostatitis.
RESULTS    				4.
RESULTS    				Granulomatous prostatitis, non specific and specific types.
RESULTS    				All types showed classic cytomorphologic inflammatory criteria.
RESULTS    				Marked atypias were found in group 3 and 4.
RESULTS    				Differential diagnosis with respect to carcinoma is not difficult, however, because marked atypias in these groups of prostatitis almost always appear focally.
RESULTS    				The diagnostic agreement between cytology and histology in 82 cases was found to be 87,6%.
CONCLUSIONS				Our results showed that prostatis may be adequately diagnosed with cytology and may be differentiated into 6 different types.
CONCLUSIONS				However, differentiation between periductal and interstitial forms of chronic prostatitis is impossible with cytology.
CONCLUSIONS				Reliable cytodiagnosis of prostatitis requires a good aspiration smear, so that at least one half of slide is covered with material from the prostate.
CONCLUSIONS				Furthermore, epithelial atypias must be present to prove the presence of prostatitis.
CONCLUSIONS				Because of the good reliability of the cytologic differentiation of prostatitis, aspiration biopsy may be a valuable aid to the clinician in the primary diagnosis of prostatitis, especially the chronic type, which currently is sometimes uncertain.

#### [Oncorna-like virus particles in the cochlear spiral ganglion of guinea pigs (author's transl)].

BACKGROUND 				Virus particles in spiral ganglion cells of the guinea pig have been grouped with herpes viruses.
BACKGROUND 				The purpose of this study was to evaluate this classification of the viruses and their influence on cell morphology.
METHODS    				20 healthy, adult guinea pigs from different breeds were studied.
METHODS    				The spiral ganglion was serially sectioned and examined electron micoscopically.
RESULTS    				All examined spiral ganglions of several guinea pig populations from different breeds showed intracytoplasmic viruses in some granular spiral ganglion cells.
RESULTS    				According to their localization and morphology we classify these viruses with the oncorna virus group.
RESULTS    				This is not in agreement with the classification of other authors.
RESULTS    				Apparently there is a world-wide latent viral infection in guinea pigs.
RESULTS    				The accumulation of lysosomal-like vacuoles in vicinity to the viruses indicates an increased local lysosomal activity of the infected ganglion cells.
RESULTS    				Considering the otherwise normal ultrastructure of the infected cells an additional influence of these viruses on the intracellular metabolism can neither be demonstrated nor denied.

#### [Electron microscopic investigation following canine pulmonary transplantation with regard to functional effects (author's transl)].

OBJECTIVE  				The function of alveolar macrophages in correlation with immunological stimulation, consequently also in pulmonary transplantation, are a subject of discussion.
OBJECTIVE  				In this study the alveolar manifestations of rejection following pulmonary transplantation, are a subject of discussion.
OBJECTIVE  				In this study the alveolar manifestations of rejection following pulmonary homotransplantation are investigated by electron microscopy.
METHODS    				In 20 healthy dogs (body weight between 7 and 19 kg) a left side pulmonary homotransplantation was performed using a standardized method.
METHODS    				2 randomized groups of 10 animals each were formed, one undergoing immunosuppressive therapy, the other none.
METHODS    				Needle biopsies (Menghini needles) were taken in both groups at the onset of rejection daily until death of the animals (on the 5th to 12th postoperative day).
METHODS    				At death of the animals always total rejection of the homograft was observed.
METHODS    				The other animals were subjected to a scheduled immunosuppressive therapy (KREUZER et al.
METHODS    				1973, RADASZKIEWICZ et al.
METHODS    				1974).
METHODS    				Needle biopsies were taken only at the stage of a clinically or roentgenologically ascertained crisis of rejection.
METHODS    				Before implantation of the homograft and 20 mins after occlusion of anastomoses and onset of circulation in the transplant biopsies were taken, too, to exclude early changes or alterations in the donor.
METHODS    				The lung specimens 2 mm in size) obtained by biopsy were fixed in phosphate buffered OSO4 and buffered phosphate solution by usual alcohol series.
METHODS    				After embedding in epon the specimens were studied by electron microscopy.
RESULTS    				In the group not undergoing immunosuppressive therapy beginning with the 3rd post-operative day perivascular lymphocytic and plasmacellular infiltrates were seen which increased during the course of rejection.
RESULTS    				In both groups a swelling and vacuolization of endoplasmatic reticulum, cytoplasmic microvilli with bridge formation accompanied by an increase of alveolar macrophages and by augmentation of lamellar bodies in granular pneumocytes were noted following operation.
RESULTS    				A correlation between the increase of lamellar bodies and increase of surfactant has been shown previously.

#### [On the problem of irreversible brain damage due to neuroleptic long-term therapy. Experimental studies on rats (author's transl)].

OBJECTIVE  				Reports in clinical literature about persistent terminal extrapyramidal hyperkinesis in neuroleptic long-term treated patients and speculation about demential brain decomposition in such cases give rise to support irreversible psychopharmacotoxical brain damage.
OBJECTIVE  				Histopathological and animal experimental results in this question given up to this day are not in agreement with each other.
OBJECTIVE  				Therefore an own chlorpromazine long-term experiment in rats is reported with special regard to biometric-statistical results.
METHODS    				Experiments were performed in 36 adult albino rats of either sex, weighing 300-400 g, fed by a standard diet, receiving food and water ad libitum.
METHODS    				The animals were divided into 3 groups of 12 animals accidentally.
METHODS    				Group I received 15 mg/kg/die chlorpromazine per os by means of a throat probe, group II 10 mg/kg/die, group III was left untreated (controls).
METHODS    				The experiment was carried out for 6 months, the animals were killed by perfusion of Bouin's solution 6-8 weeks after interruption of chlorpromazine application.
METHODS    				8 mum paraffin sections were stained by kresylviolet.
METHODS    				After histological examination the material was investigated statistically.

METHODS    				and ncl.
METHODS    				dentatus the glia/neurons ratio was stated by counting 200 cells, and in the formation reticularis 400 cells in each animal.
METHODS    				The calculated differences in the glia/neurons ratio between the groups were evaluated for statistical significance by the chi2-test.
METHODS    				In the ncl.
METHODS    				dentatus, oliva sup.,
METHODS    				ncl, cochlearis ventr.,
METHODS    				and ncl, vestibularis glia cells and neurons were counted in a plane of 1.2 mm2, in the formatio reticularis and in homologuous parts of cerebellar stratum moleculare in a plane of 2.4 mm2.
METHODS    				The differences between the mean values of the groups were verified for statistical significance by means of the t-test.
RESULTS    				In histological examination only 50% of the animals of group I showed a slight loss of neurons and increase of glia cells.
RESULTS    				Statistically however, significant increase of glia cells was found in the glia/neurons ratio all over the investigated area (rhombencephalic brain stem and cerebellum) and for the ncl.
RESULTS    				dentatus, the oliva sup.,
RESULTS    				and the ncl.
RESULTS    				cochlearis ventr.
RESULTS    				especially (table 1, fig.3).
RESULTS    				This change in the glia/neurons ratio is caused by a tendency for decreasing of neurons and increasing of glia cells, too (table 2).
RESULTS    				In the nucleus dentatus the loss of neurons was found to be of high significance.
RESULTS    				These changes are supposed to be due to chlorpromazine action, and in this manner the experimental results speak for an irreversible psychopharmacotoxical brain damage.

#### [Action of chlorphentermine on the hydrolysis of phosphatidyl choline by phospholipase A2 (author's transl)].

OBJECTIVE  				The anorectic drug chlorphentermine (Chlph) has been reported to cause lipoidosis-like cellular alterations in many organs, especially in lungs.
OBJECTIVE  				A weak inflammation has been observed during the first week of daily application.
OBJECTIVE  				After that time a pronounced foam cell production with many lamellated inclusion bodies in the cell occurs.
OBJECTIVE  				It has been supposed that this action is caused by an inhibition of phospholipid-degradation due to an association between the drug and phospholipids.
OBJECTIVE  				To substantiate this mechanism an in vitro study a bout the action of Chlph on the hydrolysis of phosphytidyl choline (PC) by phospholipase A2 (bee venom) was undertaken.
METHODS    				Pur PC was obtained by column chromatography of egg lecithin.
METHODS    				PC was used in two physical states.
METHODS    				Handshaken liposomes are used as a model of the lamellated inclusion bodies of drug- induced phospholipidosis.
METHODS    				The kinetic analysis was carried out on single bilayered liposomes obtained by injection of an ethanolic PC-solution into 0.16 M KCl.
METHODS    				Purified bee venom was used as enzyme source.
METHODS    				Usually the drug was added before the initiation of the enzyme reaction.
METHODS    				In some cases Chlph was added after starting the hydrolysis by phospholipase for a detailed characterization of the type of interaction between Chlph and PC.
METHODS    				The velocity of the enzyme reaction was measured by pH- stat titration and was expressed as mM H+-release per min.
RESULTS    				Two phases of Chlph-action are observed.
RESULTS    				A time limited stimulation of hydrolysis occurs immediatly after addition of the drug.
RESULTS    				The enzyme reaction is inhibited after the disappearence of this activation.
RESULTS    				This inhibition is independent of the physical state of the substrate and is very pronounced at equimolar mixtures of Chlph and PC (88 per cent inhibition in handshaken liposomes; 78 per cent inhibition in single bilayered liposomes).
RESULTS    				At inhibitor concentrations below 10 mol per cent the hydrolysis is not affected.
RESULTS    				By kinetic analysis it was found that the inhibitory action is due to an association between the inhibitor and the substrate.
RESULTS    				The Lineweaver-Burk- and Dixon-replots show a series of curves characteristic for this type of interaction (concave shape; no common intersections, situated in the 2nd quadrant).
RESULTS    				The intermediate stimulation of the substrate hydrolysis occurs only during the reaction of Chlph with PC.
RESULTS    				This is concluded from the following observations: The duration of activation is proportional to the inhibitor concentration as well as to the substrate concentration, i.e. it is proportional to the concentration of both reactants.
RESULTS    				The activation does not occur if the enzyme reaction is started some time after mixing inhibitor and substrate, i.e. after finishing the reaction.
RESULTS    				The results are discussed in relation to the in vivo action of Chlph.

#### [Influence of autolysis on the quantitative cytoarchitecture of rat hepatocytes. (An ultrastructural morphometric study) (author's transl)].

BACKGROUND 				Autolysis is very often a reason for cell damage and is also super-imposed on many other cell damages.
BACKGROUND 				Already one hour of autolysis causes serious changes in cell metabolism, which can be demonstrated morphometrically.
METHODS    				Experiments were made with 10 male adult Wistar rats.
METHODS    				5 animals were for control purposes and 5 animals had to undergo a 1-hour's autolysis.
METHODS    				The morphometric analysis of the liver parenchymal cells was based on the information of Weibel et al. (
METHODS    				1968) with the help of a computer program.
RESULTS    				The consequence of the drop in energy caused by autolysis is an enlargement of the liver cell which is possibly due to a breakdown of the energy-dependent ionic pumps.
RESULTS    				One of the earliest observable cell changes is a so-called "Kernwandhyperchromatosis" and chromatin condensation within the nuclei, whereby the Kernwandhyperchromatosis is seen to be a direct consequence of the increase in lactate and decrease of pH. ATP-sufficiency causes a disturbed function of mitochondrial membranes.
RESULTS    				The microchondria are swollen, the number of mitochondrial grana is clearly reduced.
RESULTS    				An enlargement of the mitochondrial outer membrane takes place by folding while the surface of mitochondrial cristae remains unchanged.
RESULTS    				As a consequence of the altered membrane activities also the peroxisomes swell at reduced numerial density.
RESULTS    				At unchanged total volume of RER the surface of the granulated membranes of the RER decrease by 50%.
RESULTS    				This decrease caused by ribosome detachment of the granulated membranes corresponds to the enlargement of the degranulated membrane parts of the nedoplasmic reticulum.
RESULTS    				The vesiculation is caused by an unspecific damage of cytoplasm.
RESULTS    				While the density of its volume and the membrane surface remain unaltered, the SER also shows a tendency to small vesiculation caused by an unspecific damage of cytoplasm.
RESULTS    				The increase in number and volume of the lysosomes and vacuoles of unknown origin speaks for a lysosomal activity.
RESULTS    				The cell compartment responsible for protein synthesis shows the most impressive morphometric and morphologic changes, which eventually can be explained by a decrease of protein synthesis which is needed to obtain enough energy for a well operating physiological equilibrium.

#### [Postmortem demonstration of portal vein collateral circulation (author's transl)].

BACKGROUND 				Postmortem investigation of esophageal varices and the portal system is difficult, because veins are collapsed at autopsy.
BACKGROUND 				The demonstration of varices is possible by illumination of the isolated mucous membrane or by puncturing esophageal varices and filing them with different materials.
METHODS    				We use a 15% aqueous gelatine solution (if needed with additional barium sulfate for x-ray examination) which is supplemented by 40% formaldehyde (40 ml in 1 1 gelatine solution).
METHODS    				The superior mesenteric vein is catheterized and filled by a clyster-pump.
RESULTS    				The mixture of gelatine and formaldehyde hardens within a few minutes.
RESULTS    				The autopsy is delayed only about half an hour.
RESULTS    				Within this time the portal system is well outlined.
RESULTS    				This method can show exactly the drainage of the portal system into the inferior vena cava.
RESULTS    				In cases of portocaval shunt or of esophageal transsection the result of the operation can be verified.
RESULTS    				The localization of the bleeding source of esophageal varices can be demonstrated by escape of the filling mass.

#### [The fructose induced "glycogenosis". I. Ultrastructural and morphometric analysis of rat hepatocytes 7 days after fructose overload (author's transl)].

BACKGROUND 				Infusion of fructose has been shown to stimulate the SER and to reduce the RER in rat liver cells.
BACKGROUND 				After feeding fructose of 7 days a glycogenosis of unknown pathogenesis occurs, which was analysed morphometrically.
METHODS    				60% fructose in water, was given as drinking water to animals deprived of other food.
METHODS    				Controls had free access to Altromin-R-standard diet and drinking water.
METHODS    				Liver tissue was analysed morphometrically according to the methods described by Weibel.
RESULTS    				Rat hepatocytes accumulate a material with histochemical properties of glycogen.
RESULTS    				The enlargement of hepatic nuclei is probably due to a pathological edema.
RESULTS    				The SER is decreased suggesting a drop of glycogen catabolizing enzymes.
RESULTS    				The drastic reduction of the RER and the non-membrane bound ribosomes are signs of inpeeded protein synthesis.
RESULTS    				According to this, the peroxisomes, which arise from the RER, are decreased in volume and number.
RESULTS    				The hepatocellular chondrioma is transformed morphometrically in a smaller number of larger, pleomorphic and cup-shaped mitochondria.
RESULTS    				The ATP level drops while, on the other hand, the cristeal membranes increase.
RESULTS    				This might be caused by a negative feed back mechanism.
RESULTS    				The hepatocellular cytoarchitecture described is similar to the one found in glycogenosis type I and in the cerebrohepato-renal syndrom.

#### Effects of tonicity on the resting tension in bullfrog ventricle.

BACKGROUND 				A study of the effects of hyper -and hypotonic media on resting tension were examined in ventricular muscle of the bullfrog was undertaken because only few studies on resting tension from the viewpoint of E-C coupling in the heart muscle are available.
METHODS    				Thin strips obtained from the bullfrog ventricle were perfused in the sucrose-gapped chamber, which allowed the effective stimulation and the simultaneous measurement of the contractile tension and the intracellular membrane potential.
RESULTS    				Hypertonic solutions up to 3.0 T, prepared by adding NaCl or sucrose, induced a triphasic response,  namely an initial rapid decline, a secondary slow development of contracture and a final transient off-contraction.
RESULTS    				Both the second and the final responses were strongly sensitive to the calcium concentration of the bathing medium and were completely abolished by depleting external calcium ions.
RESULTS    				The initial decreasing phase was not sensitive to external calcium but was progressively augmented by increasing the initial muscle length, whereas the dehydration process, estimated by measuring the muscle weight, was unaffected by muscle stretch.
RESULTS    				The changes in the membrane potential were not essential for these responses.
RESULTS    				It was concluded that the initial tension decline results from the passive process due to volume change while the sustained contracture as well as the transient off-contraction are produced by some active process involved in E-C coupling.
RESULTS    				Hypotonic solutions induced a monophasic contracture which is insensitive both to the external calcium concentration and muscle stretch.
RESULTS    				The possible mechanism for the genesis of the response was discussed.

#### [Experimental erysipelas in different species as a model for systemic connective tissue disease. I. Systemic vascular processes during organ manifestation (author's transl)].

BACKGROUND 				The similarities between erysipelas in animals and rheumatic diseases in man have been discussed since the work of Nieberle (1931).
BACKGROUND 				The present work sets out to investigate the course of organ manifestations in pigs, rats, and mice using germ-free or specific pathogen-free experimental animals.
BACKGROUND 				Particular consideration will be given to the initial systemic vascular processes as well as to the significance of the erysipelas antigen.
METHODS    				In several experiments, a total of 166 pigs--partly gnotobiotic or specific pathogen-free animals--37 specific pathogen free Wistar rats and 57 albino mice were orally and/or parenterally infected with standardized erysipelas strains of serotype B. Clinical examination post infection were carried out with the EKG and by x-raying the joints of the extremities.
METHODS    				All large parenchymatous organs, as well as heart valves, aorta and synovia were examined histologically in paraffin sections.
METHODS    				In mice and rats, joints of the extremities were embedded in toto in metracrylate.
METHODS    				Besides various histological staining methods, histochemical reactions were used to demonstrate mucopolysaccharides and fibrin.
METHODS    				The myocardium, central nervous system and synovia of several joints were examined with the electron microscope.
METHODS    				In the pig, immunohistological methods demonstrating the presence of fibrin, complement and IgG, as described by Seidler et al. (
METHODS    				1971) and Trautwein et al. (
METHODS    				1972), were used.
RESULTS    				The most important changes in joints, heart valves heart musculature and blood vessels occur during the early bacteriemic phase.
RESULTS    				A distinct sticking effect develops in the mouse 3.5 hours p.i.,
RESULTS    				in the rat 24 hours p.i.,
RESULTS    				and in the pig 36 hours p.i.
RESULTS    				Simultaneously, hyaline thrombi occur in capillaries and venules; these are seen as parallel, loosely-packed fibrin fibers in the electron microscope.
RESULTS    				With the aid of immunofluorescence fibrin, IgG and complement C3 can also be demonstrated here.
RESULTS    				Exudates rich in fibrin develop parallel to the microthrombosis.
RESULTS    				In pigs and rats vascular and myocardial necroses develop to 3  days p.i.
RESULTS    				The mice do not survive the 3rd p.i.
RESULTS    				39% of the pigs showed edema and mesenchymal activation of varying intensity in the heart valves between the 3rd and 8th day p.i.
RESULTS    				Besides the insudation of the valves, endocardial thromboses developed in 80% of the mice.
RESULTS    				Endocarditis, aand in addition large aortic thromboses were recognized in more than 50% of the rats.
RESULTS    				As early as the 4th day p.i.,
RESULTS    				coagulopathy, angionecrosis and exudation led to acute arthritic symptoms..

#### [Influence of hypothyreodism on the quantitative Karyo- and cytoarchitecture of rat hepatocytes. (A morphometrical and cytophotometrical study on rat hepatocytes 3 weeks after thyreoidectomy) (author's transl)].

BACKGROUND 				Thyroid hormoned influence the quantitative cytoarchitecture of hepatocytes by stimulating the membrane synthesis of mitochondria and ergastoplasm.
BACKGROUND 				The cellular and nuclear changes produced by thyroidectomy were analysed cytophotometrically and morphometrically.
METHODS    				21 days after thyroidectomy the liver tissues of 10 male Wistar rats were examined.
METHODS    				5 sham-operated animals served as controls.
METHODS    				All rats received Altromin-R-standard diet.
METHODS    				The cytophotometric analysis is based on the method described by Sandritter.
METHODS    				The morphometric study was carried out following Weibel's methods.
RESULTS    				As a consequence of the changed cellular metabolism, smaller hepatocytes and nuclei (but larger nucleoli) are found in the hypothyroid rats.
RESULTS    				As compared with controls, hepatocytes hardly show tetraploid nuclei, which is due to inhibited polyploidisation.
RESULTS    				The mitochondrial content has become considerably smaller in the hypothyroid hepatocytes.
RESULTS    				The cristal membranes, the mitochondrial and peroxysomal volume per hepatocyte show a similar reaction pattern, which is considered to be a sign of reduced cellular metabolism.
RESULTS    				The volume loss of the ergastoplasm confirms this assumption.

#### [Experimental erysipelas in different species as a model for systemic connective tissue disease. II. The chronic phase with special reference to polyarthritis (author's transl)].

BACKGROUND 				In part I of this paper (Schulz et al.,
BACKGROUND 				1975) it was shown that in the initial phase of experimental erysipelas a transition from the vascular processes to a systemic connective tissue reaction can be demonstrated in different species.
BACKGROUND 				It is the purpose of this paper to describe the chronic phase of the disease with special emphasis on polyarthritis.
METHODS    				12 spontaneously diseased and 22 experimentally infected pigs were used in experiments to study the pathogenesis of the disease.
METHODS    				In addition, 74 Wistar rats and 148 Sprague-Dawley rats were used in the experiments.
METHODS    				All experimental animals were specific-pathogen-free and were parenterally infected with the standardized E. insidiosa serotype B strain T 28.
METHODS    				The observation period for the pigs was up to 2 years, for the rats up to 11 months.
METHODS    				The methods used for pathohistological and electron microscopical studies are described in part I. Immunihistological studies were carried out on synovial tissue with peroxidase-conjugates of goat-anti-pig-IgG, goat-anti-pig-IgM, pig-collagen, E. insidiosa-homogenate and heat-aggregated-pig-IgG. Furthermore, goat-anti-pig-IgG and rabbit-anti-pig-C3 conjugated with FITC were used.
METHODS    				Passive hemagglutination tests and Latex agglutination test (Singer and Plotz) were performed to demonstrate rheumatoid factors and collagen antibodies.
RESULTS    				Polyarthritis occurred in pigs between the 4th and 10th day p.i.
RESULTS    				and between the 4th and 8th day p.i.
RESULTS    				in nearly 100% of the infected rats.
RESULTS    				Fibrinous exudation, proliferation and destruction with pannus formation are marked in most of the joints examined during the first three months.
RESULTS    				Fibrosis begins 30 days p.i.
RESULTS    				in the rats' joints and is most severe in both species between the 5th and 8th month.
RESULTS    				3 types of lining cells may be differentiated electron microscopically: A (M) cells, B (F) cells and an intermediate form which is found in both species most frequently.
RESULTS    				Swelling of the endothelial cells together with constriction of the lumen and thickening of the basal membrane occurs in the capillaries.
CONCLUSIONS				A comparison of chronic erysipelas polyarthritis in pigs and rats with rheumatoid arthritis of men reveals many morphological and immunological similarities between the two diseases.
CONCLUSIONS				Systemic connective tissue activation manifests itself in organs predilected for rheumatic changes, such as heart valves, endocardium and joints.
CONCLUSIONS				The possible prepetuation of the processes by specific or nonspecific immunomechanisms or by deposits of fibrin is discussed.
CONCLUSIONS				In addition, experimental erysipelas is reproducible in nearly 100% of the animals given one single subcutaneous application of one defined bacteria strain.
CONCLUSIONS				Therefore too, erysipelas is suited as an animal model for human rheumatic diseases.

#### [Ultrastructural observations in the lamina elastica interna and adjacent tissue regions of the arterioles of rats impaired by hypertension of different pathogenesis (author's transl)].

OBJECTIVE  				The experiments aim to answer the question whether early changes in the lamine elastica interna of peripheral arteries causing consecutive plasmatic insudation of the vascular wall ("plasmatic vasculosis" according to GOLDBLATT) can be visualized by electron microscopy.
OBJECTIVE  				Demonstration of early lesions in the elastica interna would facilitate the interpretation of structural changes in the arterial periphery during acute hypertension and its consecutive symptoms.
METHODS    				37 male albino rats, 3 to 4 1/2 months of age, body weight: 250 to 350 g. Controls 19 rats of similar age and body weight, 6 of which were injected the carrier substance of depot angiotensin PVP (VEB Berlin-Chemie).
METHODS    				The test arrangement is represented in table 1.
METHODS    				3 hours to 10 weeks after starting the treatment different groups of experimental animals were sacrificed.
METHODS    				Several animals were administered tracer substances for demonstration of early disturbances in permeability (ferritin: 20 to 40 mg per 100 g body weight, 3 to 60 min ante mortem; charcoal: 10 to 20 mg per 100 g body weight diluted in 1.5 to 3.0 ml of distilled water 15 to 30 min ante mortem).
METHODS    				Electron microscopic investigations were carried out in arterioles of 15 mum to 100 mum in diameter which had been removed from the stomach, colon, jejunum, pancreas, mesenterium, partially from the brain and heart, in cases also from the lungs.
METHODS    				For comparable specimens with respect to early ultrastructural changes only such tissue sections were selected that were light microscopically free from lesions.
METHODS    				Preparation for electron microscopy was done in the common way.
RESULTS    				in light microscopically intact arterioles of all 3 groups (see table 1) the well-known disturbances of intimal permeability were electron microscopically observed already after 3 hours of experimentation.
RESULTS    				These changes occur always in the splanchnic organs and in the heart.
RESULTS    				Contrarily they do not regularly occur in the brain.
RESULTS    				In rats impaired by experimental neurosis (group III) the disturbances in perfusion of the intima recede, the consequences of enhanced metabolix activity in the media predominate in the sence of a "non-specific mesenchymal reaction" (HAUSS et al.
RESULTS    				1964).
RESULTS    				However, it should be taken into consideration that this enhanced metabolic activity and cell proliferation may actually warrant the relative stability of the elastic barrier observed in this experimental group.
RESULTS    				In rats with nephrogenic and angiotensin-induced hypertension the experiments result in principally similar lesions of the lamina elastica interna originating from the vascular lumen.
RESULTS    				The diverging results in rats impaired by neurotically conditioned disturbed regulation of the blood pressure speak in favor of a prevailing reaction of the media at well preserved structures of the lamina elastica interna.

METHODS    				Details on materials and methods were given in a recent paper [PHILIPPSON, Exp.
METHODS    				Path.
METHODS    				8, 182-193 (1973)].
METHODS    				Glutaminase I activities (L-glutamine amidohydrolase, EC 3.5.1.2.)
METHODS    				were quantitatively analyzed according to MATTENHEIMER and DEBRUIN (7) in which the reaction was not only produced by cooling but also by simultaneous inhibition by means of 15% trichloric acetic acid.
METHODS    				Ammonia was released and determined by Berthelot's reaction as modified by WELLER (18).
RESULTS    				The results in rabbit kidneys are compiled in the tables 1-3, the observations on human kidneys are represented in table 4.
RESULTS    				139 rabbits showed unilateral experimental pyelonephritis, in 19 rabbits pyelonephritis did not develop or "healed up spontaneously".
RESULTS    				31 samples of pyelonephritic nephrocirrhotic human kidneys (obtained by surgical operations) and 20 samples of healthy human kidneys were investigated.
RESULTS    				After separation of renal cortex and medulla the cortex was separated into glomerula and renal tubules by differential centrifugation.
RESULTS    				Significance was tested by universal comparison of the group mean values by t-test (rabbit and human kidneys separately).
RESULTS    				1.
RESULTS    				In the rabbit glomerula glutaminase I (glut I) activities were increased significantly from the beginning of the experiment up to 100 days.
RESULTS    				They decreased markedly in the subsequent nephrocirrhotic stage (fig.
RESULTS    				1).
RESULTS    				2.
RESULTS    				The glut I activities in the rabbit cortical tubules decreased immediately, intensively and succesively up to the late-chronic nephrocirrhotic stage.
RESULTS    				3.
RESULTS    				The rabbit medullary glut I showed likewise intensive decrease in the acute and subacute phase progressing to very low activities in the nephrocirrhotic stages.
RESULTS    				4.
RESULTS    				In all samples from human pyelonephritic nephrocirrhoses (glomerula, cortical tubules and medulla) extremely decreased glut I activities were demonstrated.
RESULTS    				5.

RESULTS    				Path.
RESULTS    				9, 280-287 (1974)] are closely correlated.
RESULTS    				6.
RESULTS    				In the glomerula of the "spontaneously healed up" tissue the glut I activities were markedly increased whereas they were moderately decreased in the cortical tubules and in the medulla.
RESULTS    				7.
RESULTS    				The dry weights and values of protein content were equal to those earlier reported (PHILIPPSON 1973).
RESULTS    				8.
RESULTS    				In the significance test (universally applied t-test) the overwhelming majority of the values showed high significance (p less than or equal to 0.001).
RESULTS    				The results are correlated with the observations of the semiquantitative histological analysis (SORGER et al.
RESULTS    				1974) and discussed on the basis of data reported in literature.

METHODS    				For details of the test arrangement see AUBOCK and MITSCHEK, Exp.
METHODS    				Path.
METHODS    				9, 323--335 (1974).
METHODS    				From one portion of the material for histological examination cryostat sections were prepared, the other portion was fixed in Bouin's solution or in Baker's formol and paraffin-embedded at 58--60 degrees C (cross sections of the aorta).
METHODS    				The specimens were stained as follows: erythrosin in conjunction with haematoxylin; aqueous or alcoholic solutions of toluidine blue (pH 3.5 to 5, and 7); methylene blue (pH 2.5 to 5, and 8); alcian blue (pH 2.5); Schiff-PAS; alcian blue and PAS in combination; Sudan III; elastica-van Gieson (blue) and Weigert's iron haematoxylin.
METHODS    				For demonstration of mucopolysaccharides (MPS) the control sections were pretreated in a 10% Takadiastase solution for 10 minutes at 37 degrees C. In liver sections PAS-reactivity was additionally blocked by dimedone (cyclohexanedione) for elective demonstration of glycogen.
METHODS    				The tissue sections were studied in transmission--, incident- and dark field illumination.
RESULTS    				lipid deposits as demonstrated by surface preparation technique could not be seen in paraffin sections after just one day.
RESULTS    				In the vascular wall histological changes were earliest visible after 10 to 14 days (enlargement of the subendothelial space and honeycombed edema with fine dispersed lipids).
RESULTS    				At this stage a "haematoxylin-effect" did yet not develop.
RESULTS    				Sometimes these alterations were also present in the upper layers of the media.
RESULTS    				They always first occurred in the aortic arch.
RESULTS    				At this time the Sol.
RESULTS    				Mel.-treated animals of group II only occasionally developed superficial edemas.
RESULTS    				Enlargement of the media with edematous infiltration and loosening of the elastic fibers was similar in both cases (figs.
RESULTS    				1a and 1b).
RESULTS    				Fatty degeneration of the liver was already macroscopically visible on day 14; in untreated animals of group I it was more expressive than in group II (figs.
RESULTS    				2a and 2b) -- this likewise applied to the cholesterol content (figs.
RESULTS    				3a and 3b).
RESULTS    				After about 30 days in group I the earliest macroscopically visible plaques occurred prevailingly in the aortic arch and in the thoracic aorta.
RESULTS    				The development of such small foam cell plaques could be continuously observed with a hand lens (fig.
RESULTS    				4a).
RESULTS    				In group II, however, it was not possible to observe any development of plaques with a hand lens, persistence of edemas was demonstrable with such (fig.
RESULTS    				4b).
RESULTS    				Within these, fine dispersed droplets were present (fig.
RESULTS    				5) but exact localization was only possible by electron microscopy [see literature(2)].

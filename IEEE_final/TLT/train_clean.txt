#### IP Addressing: Problem-Based Learning Approach on Computer Networks


0	  The case study presented in this paper describes the pedagogical aspects and experience gathered while using an e-learning tool named IPA-PBL.
0	  Its main purpose is to provide additional motivation for adopting theoretical principles and procedures in a computer networks course.
1     In the proposed model, the sequencing of activities of the learning process is grouped into three phases based on educational goals.
1     In this way, the same tool is used on several courses with different curricula.
1	  In IPA-PBL, problem-based learning (PBL) is applied as a pedagogical strategy, as well as a set of concrete methods implemented in the software.
1     Together with the pedagogical model, specific domain ontology is designed.
1     In this way, the learner's knowledge can be analyzed in order to collect data necessary for the dynamic adaptation of system behavior.
2	  The results collected while using IPA-PBL are compared to those obtained without using the system.
2     Statistical analysis, together with pertaining considerations and conclusions, are also presented in the paper.

#### Needles in the Haystack: Finding Content Worth Preparing for Workplace Learning with the KEP Model


0	  Knowledge transfer between employees is a primary concern in organizations.
0	  Employees create or acquire content that partially represents knowledge.
0    These knowledge elements are specific to the context in and for which they are created and rarely address the learning needs of other employees in other work situations.
0     Organizations therefore need to support the preparation of knowledge elements to facilitate knowledge transfer, but often have limited resources to process a plethora of content.
1	  This paper presents the Knowledge Element Preparation (KEP) model that helps to structure the complex decision to select knowledge elements worthy of preparation out of ample available content and assign them to preparation tasks.
1	  The model combines the benefits of prepared knowledge elements in workplace learning, which we identified in an ethnographically informed study of a software development company, with efforts discussed in the literature.
1	  We implemented and reflected on the model in a case study of a research and development project.
2     Our findings suggest that we can estimate the benefits of adaptively delivered content based on the importance of topics, types of knowledge elements, and preparation tasks.
2     We also contribute personas, dimensions of knowledge elements, and knowledge work situations as instruments to facilitate the instantiation of the KEP model.

#### Teaching with a Dual-Channel Classroom Feedback System in the Digital Classroom Environment


0	  Teaching with a classroom feedback system can benefit both teaching and learning practices of interactivity.
1	  In this paper, we propose a dual-channel classroom feedback system integrated with a back-end e-Learning system.
1	  The system consists of learning agents running on the students' computers and a teaching agent running on the instructor's computer.
1	  The learning agent collects both instructional and social responses from the students and then sends them back to the instructor's computer through a two-channel mechanism.
1     The instructional responses are obtained by recognizing the spoken keywords; while the social responses are obtained by analyzing the social signals provided by students' head movements.
1     Later, the teaching agent displays the summarized responses on the teaching dashboard for the instructor to evaluate their teaching practices.
2     Empirical experiment results show that the system has an acceptable performance and provides enhanced interactivity in both learning and teaching.
2     Also, further analysis reveals that the dual-channel mechanism not only provides the basic functions of a classroom feedback system, the student's responses to the instructor's questions, but also promotes both students and instructors to be engaged and attentive in class.
2     As the two-channel feedback mechanism can be embedded into an e-Learning system, the proposed system is an enhancement of a digital classroom environment.
2     In short, with the help of the two-channel feedback mechanism, interactivity on teaching practices and learning activities can be greatly improved.
2     Students can then acquire a much better learning experience and satisfaction.

#### Adaptive Social Learning Based on Crowdsourcing


0	  Many techniques have been developed to enhance learning experience with computer technology.
0	  A particularly great influence of technology on learning came with the emergence of the web and adaptive educational hypermedia systems.
0     While the web enables users to interact and collaborate with each other to create, organize, and share knowledge via user-generated content, majority of e-learning systems do not utilize the power of their users to create high quality educational content and provide data for adaptive algorithms.
1	  In this paper, we introduce a novel social learning framework that allows anybody to author educational content in a form of mini-lessons, learn lessons by following adaptive learning pathways as well as interact with their peers as in any social network.
1	  The proposed approach combines concepts of crowd-sourcing, online social networks, and complex adaptive systems to engage users in efficient learning through teaching process.
1	  We first describe the main idea behind the framework and how users interact with it, and then we describe SALT system that implements the framework.
1	  We also performed evaluation of the SALT system via several classroom studies.
2     Our results show that collective learning experiences can be efficiently utilized in adaptive social learning.
2     We found that students tend to form stable clusters that survive very high similarity threshold.
2     Meanwhile, our learning pathway analysis showed that almost all students have their own unique best pathway.
2     Experiments with various recommendation algorithms showed that most algorithms obtain very small penalty in all classes.

#### Integrating Model-Driven and Data-Driven Techniques for Analyzing Learning Behaviors in Open-Ended Learning Environments


0	  Research in computer-based learning environments has long recognized the vital role of adaptivity in promoting effective, individualized learning among students.
0	  Adaptive scaffolding capabilities are particularly important in open-ended learning environments, which provide students with opportunities for solving authentic and complex problems, and the choice to adopt a variety of strategies and approaches to solving these problems.
0	  To help students overcome their difficulties and become effective learners and problem solvers, we have to develop methods that can track and interpret students' open-ended learning and problem-solving behaviors.
0	  The complexity of the problems and the open-ended nature of the solution processes pose considerable challenges to accurately interpret and evaluate student behaviors and performance as they work on the system.
1	  In this paper, we develop a framework that combines model-driven strategy detection with data-driven pattern discovery for analyzing students' learning activity data in open-ended environments.
2	  We present results from an in-depth case study of multiple activity patterns identified in data from the Betty's Brain learning environment.
2     The results illustrate the benefits of combining model- and data-driven techniques to precisely characterize the learning behavior of students in an open-ended environment.

#### Learning How to Construct Models of Dynamic Systems: An Initial Evaluation of the Dragoon Intelligent Tutoring System


0	  Constructing models of dynamic systems is an important skill in both mathematics and science instruction.
0	  However, it has proved difficult to teach.
1     Dragoon is an intelligent tutoring system intended to quickly and effectively teach this important skill.
1	  This paper describes Dragoon and an evaluation of it.
2	  The evaluation randomly assigned students in a university class to either Dragoon or baseline instruction that used Dragoon as an editor only.
2     Among students who did use their systems, the tutored students scored reliably higher (p <; .021, d = 1.06) on the post-test than the students who used only the conventional editor-based instruction.

#### Cognitive Diffusion Model: Facilitating EFL Learning in an Authentic Environment


0	  For this study, we designed learning activities in which students applied newly acquired knowledge to solve meaningful daily life problems in their local community - a real, familiar, and relevant environment for students.
0	  For example, students learned about signs and rules in class and then applied this new knowledge to create their own rules for a location in their community (e.g., playground rules that tell visitors what is or is not allowed to do in a local playground) to make it more environmentally friendly.
1	  To facilitate this, we developed a mobile learning system equipped with a dictionary as well as textual annotation, recording, and sharing functions.
1	  This mobile learning system enables students to take pictures of objects, describe them verbally or in writing, and share their work with peers.
1	  Our goal was to study the effectiveness of learning activities supported by a mobile learning system on the cognitive learning process by examining the changes in students' cognitive processes and the distribution of students who reach a certain level of cognition before and after learning.
1	  Fifty-seven junior high school students participated in the research, and their views of the mobile learning system and interest in continuing use were also explored.
1	  Students were divided into one control (n = 26) group and one experimental (n = 31) group.
1	  The control group completed learning activities using a traditional approach while the experimental group used a learning system installed in tablet PCs.
1	  The effectiveness of the mobile PC system on students' cognitive processes was tested by comparing the control and experimental groups' pre-test and post-test outcomes.
1	  Changes in students' cognitive processes were measured by calculating the differences in student scores among three tasks.
1	  The distribution of students who reached a certain level of cognition was derived based on their learning performance.
1	  Students' perceptions were evaluated using a questionnaire survey.
1     The mobile learning system kept records of how students used it.
2     Our results show that the experimental students significantly outperformed the control students on test items related to high cognitive levels.
2     Students made clear cognitive progress from the second topic to the third one.
2     Most students rated the learning system highly and want to use it in the future.
2     Finally, the results show that creating text annotations is the best indicator of learning.
2     Based on these results, we recommend applying appropriate learning activities supported by a mobile learning system to facilitate students' cognitive processes when they are studying English as a foreign language in an authentic environment.

#### Automatic Chinese Factual Question Generation


0	  Question generation is an emerging research area of artificial intelligence in education.
0	  Question authoring tools are important in educational technologies, e.g., intelligent tutoring systems, as well as in dialogue systems.
0	  Approaches to generate factual questions, i.e., questions that have concrete answers, mainly make use of the syntactical and semantic information in a declarative sentence, which is then transformed into questions.
0	  Recently, some research has been conducted to investigate Chinese factual question generation with some limited success.
0	  Reported performance is poor due to unavoidable errors (e.g., sentence parsing, name entity recognition, and rule-based question transformation errors) and the complexity of long Chinese sentences.
1	  This article introduces a novel Chinese question generation system based on three stages, sentence simplification, question generation and ranking, to address the challenge of automatically generating factual questions in Chinese.
1	  The proposed approach and system have been evaluated on sentences from the New Practical Chinese Reader corpus.
2     Experimental results show that ranking improves more than 20 percentage of questions rated as acceptable by annotators, from 65 percent of all questions to 87 percent of the top ranked 25 percent questions.

#### An Architecture Combining IMS-LD and Web Services for Flexible Data-Transfer in CSCL


1	  This article presents evaluation data regarding the MAPIS3 architecture which is proposed as a solution for the data-transfer among various tools to promote flexible collaborative learning designs.
1	  We describe the problem that this architecture deals with as “tool orchestration” in collaborative learning settings.
1     This term refers to a situation where data relevant to a collaborative learning activity need to be forwarded to and processed by various learning technological tools (e.g. a forum, a pedagogical agent, a service or a software component that provides a specific functionality, etc.), in order for the collaborative activity to be efficiently represented and teachers' pedagogical level decisions implemented.
1	  To facilitate data-transfer among the various tools and accomplish flexible interventions during runtime, the architecture employs a key component (“mediator component”) which makes use of an IMS-LD based representation of the activity.
2	  By implementing the architecture tradeoff analysis method in three case studies, evaluation data regarding the proposed architecture have been recorded and are presented in this paper.
2	  Targeted stakeholders (learners, teachers, and developers) provided valuable insights on the capacity of the architecture to efficiently facilitate tool orchestration during the realization of a flexible IMS-LD based course.
2     Additionally, limitations of IMS-LD are discussed and suggestions are made on how to tackle these constraints and increase flexibility during tool orchestration in collaborative learning deployment.

#### CMX: The Effects of an Educational MMORPG on Learning and Teaching Computer Programming


0	  Computer programming has for decades posed several difficulties for students of all educational levels.
0	  A number of teaching approaches have been proposed over the years but none seems to fulfil the needs of students nowadays.
0     Students use computers mainly for playing games and the Internet and as quite a few researchers state this aspect of computers should be taken into account in the way we educate them.
1	  Towards this direction, this paper aims to examine the effects of using an educational Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG) on teaching and learning computer programming.
1	  The educational features of an MMORPG called CMX are presented along with a design framework that was devised taking into account previous work in designing educational games.
1	  The effects of CMX on teaching and learning computer programming are assessed through a study with first-year undergraduate students.
1	  Seventy six students used CMX over a period of five weeks for learning various procedural programming concepts.
1	  Students evaluated various aspects of CMX byfilling in a questionnaire that was based on an evaluation framework, which was devised in accordance with the design framework of CMX.
1	  Moreover, the results of a midterm exam that took place priorto using CMX and students' accomplishments in the context of CMX were recorded and analyzed.
2	  The results show that the majority of the students was entertained by playing the game while learning, and felt motivated to continue based on the game's scenario due to the variety of activities included.
2	  In regards to the students' performance, a pre-test and a post-test were carried out in the experimental group, i.e., the participants of this study, and the control group, i.e., students of the course that continued to get taught the same concepts and performed the same assignments as the experimental group, but traditionally.
2     The pre-test and post-test analysis of the performance results for both groups showed that the majority of the students in the experimental group increased their performance in computer programming.
2     Furthermore, students stated they had a positive attitude in regards to re-using CMX in the future in order to learn additional programming concepts.
2     The positive results of this study pave the way for CMX being used in the classroom and expanding the game's functionalities that will further increase students' performance and support teachers in delivering the required knowledge.
2     Moreover, the work reported in this paper offers game designers and teachers methodological and empirical results for game-based learning in such a difficult domain as is computer programming.
2     What is more, the design and evaluation frameworks presented are general enough that they can be easily adjusted and/or extended for designing and assessing educational games in other domains as well.

#### Investigating the Impact of Gaming Habits, Gender, and Age on the Effectiveness of an Educational Video Game: An Exploratory Study


1	  This study examines the influence of players' age, gender, and gaming preferences and habits (from now on, “gaming preferences”) on the effectiveness of a specific videogame that has been designed to increase the interest towards classical theater among teenagers.
1	  Using a validated instrument, participants were divided into four groups based on their gaming preferences: (1) Well-rounded (WR) gamers, who play all types of games often; (2) Hardcore players, who frequently tend to play first-person shooter (FPS) and sports games; (3) Casual players, who play moderately and tend to play music, social, and puzzle games; and (4) Non-gamers, who barely play videogames at all.
2     Among all of the participants' personal factors (age, gender, and type of player) that were measured, only gaming preferences seemed to have a significant (p<;.05) positive influence on students' interest in theater-going.
2     Neither age nor gender seemed to affect the outcomes.
2	  Casual and Well-rounded gamers scored higher in the game than Non-gamers and Hardcore players.
1	  Due to these results, we also explored whether the gaming profile affected traditional educational approaches.
2     Traditional education worked better than videogames only for students who do not usually play videogames.
2     This study suggests that gaming preferences may influence the effectiveness of different educational approaches.
2     Knowing students' gaming preferences in advance may help educators find the best educational approach for each student.

#### A Fuzzy Group Decision Making Model for Ordinal Peer Assessment


0	  Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are becoming an increasingly popular choice for education but, to reach their full extent, they require the resolution of new issues like assessing students at scale.
0	  A feasible approach to tackle this problem is peer assessment, in which students also play the role of assessor for assignments submitted by others.
0     Unfortunately, students are unreliable graders so peer assessment often does not deliver accurate results.
1	  In order to mitigate this issue, we propose a new model for ordinal peer assessment based on the principles of fuzzy group decision making.
1	  In our approach, each student is asked to rank a few random submissions from the best to the worst and to specify, with a set of intuitive labels, at what extent each submission is better than the following one in the ranking.
1	  Students' provided rankings are then transformed in fuzzy preference relations, expanded to estimate missing values and aggregated through OWA operators.
1	  The aggregated relation is then used to generate a global ranking between the submissions and to estimate their absolute grades.
2     Experimental results are presented and show better performances with respect to other existing ordinal and cardinal peer assessment techniques both in the reconstruction of the correct ranking and on the estimation of students' grades.

#### Towards Actionable Learning Analytics Using Dispositions


0	  Studies in the field of learning analytics (LA) have shown students' demographics and learning management system (LMS) data to be effective identifiers of “at risk” performance.
0	  However, insights generated by these predictive models may not be suitable for pedagogically informed interventions due to the inability to explain why students display these behavioral patterns.
0	  Therefore, this study aims at providing explanations of students' behaviors on LMS by incorporating dispositional dimensions (e.g., self-regulation and emotions) into conventional learning analytics models.
1	  Using a combination of demographic, trace, and self-reported data of eight contemporary social-cognitive theories of education from 1,069 students in a blended introductory quantitative course, we demonstrate the potential of dispositional characteristics of students, such as procrastination and boredom.
2     Our results highlight the need to move beyond simple engagement metrics, whereby dispositional learning analytics provide an actionable bridge between learning analytics and educational intervention.

#### Predicting Student Performance from LMS Data: A Comparison of 17 Blended Courses Using Moodle LMS


0	  With the adoption of Learning Management Systems (LMSs) in educational institutions, a lot of data has become available describing students' online behavior.
0	  Many researchers have used these data to predict student performance.
0	  This has led to a rather diverse set of findings, possibly related to the diversity in courses and predictor variables extracted from the LMS, which makes it hard to draw general conclusions about the mechanisms underlying student performance.
1	  We first provide an overview of the theoretical arguments used in learning analytics research and the typical predictors that have been used in recent studies.
1	  We then analyze 17 blended courses with 4,989 students in a single institution using Moodle LMS, in which we predict student performance from LMS predictor variables as used in the literature and from in-between assessment grades, using both multi-level and standard regressions.
2     Our analyses show that the results of predictive modeling, notwithstanding the fact that they are collected within a single institution, strongly vary across courses.
2     Thus, the portability of the prediction models across courses is low.
2     In addition, we show that for the purpose of early intervention or when in-between assessment grades are taken into account, LMS data are of little (additional) value.
2     We outline the implications of our findings and emphasize the need to include more specific theoretical argumentation and additional data sources other than just the LMS data.

1	  In order to test whether the information visualized by the widget is in line with the study outcomes, we instantiated the widget indicators with data from four previous runs of the European Virtual Seminar on Sustainable Development (EVS).
1	  We analyzed whether the tutor gradings in these previous years correlated with the students' scores calculated for the widget indicators.
1	  Furthermore, we tested the predictive power of the widget indicators at various points in time with respect to the final grades of the students.

#### A Novel Web-Based Approach for Visualization and Inspection of Reading Difficulties on University Students


0	  Existing tools aim to detect university students with early diagnosis of dyslexia or reading difficulties, but there are not developed tools that let those students better understand some aspects of their difficulties.
1	  In this paper, a dashboard for visualizing and inspecting early detected reading difficulties and their characteristics, called PADA (acronym for the Spanish name Panel de Analíticas de Aprendizaje de Dislexia en Adultos), is presented.
1     PADA is a web-based tool designed to facilitate the creation of descriptive visualizations required for a better understanding by students about their learner model.
1     Through information visualization techniques, PADA shows students the knowledge in their learner models in order to help them to increase their awareness and to support reflection and self-regulation about their difficulties in reading.
2     PADA provides different learning analytics on reading performance of students, so that they can self-identify their strengths and weaknesses and self-regulate their learning.
1	  This paper describes examples that cover a variety of visualizations (bar-charts, line-charts, and pie-charts) to show user model fragments as personal details, reading profiles, learning styles, and cognitive traits of the students.
1	  We tested PADA with 26 students (aged 21-53 years) of different academic programs and levels, dyslexic and non-dyslexic.
2	  The results show that PADA can assist students in creating awareness, and help them to understand their difficulties associated with the reading tasks, as well as facilitate reflection and self-regulation in the learning process.
2     Implications for the design of learning analytics are discussed and directions for future work are outlined.

0	  Similarly, learning analytics research proposes the combination of detailed data traces derived from technology-mediated tasks with a variety of algorithms to predict student academic performance.
0	  The former approach is designed to provide meaningful pedagogical guidance, while the latter is designed to identify event patterns and relations that can be translated into actionable remediation.
0     The benefits of both approaches have motivated this study to investigate if a combination of the self-report data and data arising from an observation of the engagement of students with online learning events offers a deeper understanding and explanation of why some students achieve relatively higher levels of academic performance.
1     In this paper we explore how to combine data about self-regulated learning skills with observable measures of online activity in a blended learning course to increase predictive capabilities of student academic performance for the purposes of informing teaching and task design.
1     A case study in a course with 145 students showed that the variation of the students' final score for their course is better explained when factors from both approaches are considered.

#### Predicting Contextual Informativeness for Vocabulary Learning


0	  Vocabulary knowledge is essential to educational progress.
0	  High quality vocabulary instruction requires supportive contextual examples to teach word meaning and proper usage.
0     Identifying such contexts by hand for a large number of words can be difficult.
1	  In this work, we take a statistical learning approach to engineer a system that predicts informativeness of a context for target words that span the range of difficulty from middle school to college level.
1	  Our database (released open source) includes 1,000 hand-selected words associated with approximately 70,000 contextual examples gathered from the Internet.
1	  Our training data included each context rated by 10 individuals on a four-point informativeness scale.
1	  We process the text of each context into a novel collection of approximately 600 numerical features that captures diverse linguistic information.
1	  We then fit a nonparametric regression model using Random Forests and compute out-of-sample prediction performance using cross-validation.
2     Our system performs well enough that it can replace a human judge: for a target word not found in our dataset, we can provide curated contexts to a student learner such that most of the contexts (54 percent) feature rich contextual clues and confusing contexts are rare ( <; 1 percent).
2     Thabstract_segmentation_modele quality of our curated contexts was validated by an independent panel of high school language arts teachers.

0	  Textbook highlighting is widely considered to be beneficial for students.
1	  In this paper, we propose a comprehensive solution to highlight the online lecture videos in both sentence and segment-level, just as is done with paper books.
2     The solution is based on automatic analysis of multimedia lecture materials, such as speeches, transcripts, and slides, in order to facilitate the online learners in this era of e-learning - especially with MOOCs.
2     Sentence-level lecture highlighting basically uses acoustic features from the audio and the output is implemented in subtitle files of corresponding MOOC videos.
2     In comparison with ground truth created by experts, the precision is over 60 percent, which is better than baseline works and also welcomed by user feedbacks.
2     On the other hand, segment-level lecture highlighting works with statistical analysis, mainly by exploring the speech transcripts, the lecture slides and their connections.
2     With the ground truth created by massive users, an evaluation process shows that general accuracy can reach 70 percent, which is fairly promising.
2     Finally, we also attempt to find potential correlation between these two types of lecture highlights.

#### Student Emotions in Conversation-Based Assessments


0	  Students can experience a variety of emotions while completing assessments.
0	  Some emotions can get in the way of students performing their best (e.g., anxiety, frustration), whereas other emotions can facilitate student performance (e.g., engagement).
0     Many new, non-traditional assessments, such as automated conversation-based assessments (CBA), are designed with the intention to create a test-taking experience that maximizes beneficial emotions for students and minimizes detrimental emotions.
0	  However, there is a paucity of research on students' actual emotional experiences during these non-traditional assessments.
1	  Across two studies, we investigated students' moment-to-moment emotions during two CBAs that differed on construct (science inquiry, mathematical reasoning) and environment (virtual world, chat box).
1	  We found a similar set of emotions to frequently occur across the two studies and came to the preliminary conclusion that students have a generally positive experience with CBAs and that boredom, confusion, curiosity, delight, engagement/flow, frustration, happiness/enjoyment, hope, and pride are the prevalent emotions in CBAs.
1	  The temporal dynamics of emotions as well as the emotion-performance relationship were also investigated across the two studies.
2     Lastly, we discuss how these findings can inform the development of emotion-sensitive CBAs that can facilitate students being able to perform to the best of their ability.

#### Let's Set Up Some Subgoals: Understanding Human-Pedagogical Agent Collaborations and Their Implications for Learning and Prompt and Feedback Compliance


0	  Research on collaborative learning between humans and virtual pedagogical agents represents a necessary extension to recent research on the conceptual, theoretical, methodological, analytical, and educational issues behind co-and socially-shared regulated learning between humans.
1	  This study presents a novel coding framework that was developed and used to describe collaborations between learners and a pedagogical agent (PA) during a subgoal setting activity with MetaTutor, an intelligent tutoring system.
1	  Learner-PA interactions were examined across two scaffolding conditions: prompt and feedback (PF), and control.
1	  Learners' compliance to follow the PA's prompts and feedback in the PF condition were also examined.
2     Results demonstrated that learners followed the PA's prompts and feedback to help them set more appropriate subgoals for their learning session the majority of the time.
2     Descriptive statistics revealed that when subgoals were set collaboratively between learners and the PA, they generally lead to higher proportional learning gains when compared to less collaboratively set goals.
2     Taken together, the results provide preliminary evidence that learners are both willing to engage in and benefit from collaborative interactions with PAs when immediate, directional feedback and the opportunity to try again are provided.
2     Implications and future directions for extending co-and socially-shared regulated learning theories to include learner-PA interactions are proposed.

1	  In this study, we investigate if a digital coach for low-literate learners that provides cognitive learning support based on scaffolding can be improved by adding affective learning support based on motivational interviewing, and social learning support based on small talk.
1	  Several knowledge gaps are identified: motivational interviewing and small talk must be translated to control rules for this coach, a formal model of participant emotional states is needed to allow the coach to parse the learner's emotional state, and various sensors must be used to let the coach detect and act on this state.
1     We use the situated Cognitive Engineering (sCE) method to update an existing foundation of knowledge with emotional models, motivational interviewing, and small talk theory, technology, and a new exercise in the volunteer work domain.
1	  We use this foundation to create a design specification for an Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) coach that provides cognitive, affective, and social learning support for this exercise.
1     A prototype is created, and compared to a prototype that only provides cognitive support in a within- and between-subjects experiment.
2     Results show that both prototypes work as expected: learners interact with the coach and complete all exercises.
2     Almost no significant differences are found between the two prototypes, indicating that the affective and social support were not effective as designed.
2     Potential improvements are provided for future work.
2     Results also show significant differences between two subgroups of low-literate participants, and between men and women, reinforcing the importance of using individualized support measures with this demographic.

1	  We propose a novel concept, Be the Data, to explore the possibilities of using human's embodied resources to learn from high-dimensional data.
1     In our implemented system, each student embodies a data point, and the position of students in a physical space represents a 2D projection of the high-dimensional data.
1     Students physically move within the room with respect to each other to collaboratively construct alternative projections and receive visual feedback about relevant data dimensions.
1     In this way, students can pose hypotheses about the data to discover the statistical support as well as learn about complex concepts such as high-dimensional distance.
2	  We conducted educational workshops with students in various age groups inexperienced in complex data analytical methods.
2     Our findings indicate that Be the Data provided the necessary engagement to enable students to quickly learn about high-dimensional data and analysis processes despite their minimal prior knowledge.

1	  We propose a method of generating teaching policies for use in intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) for concept learning tasks [1] , e.g., teaching students the meanings of words by showing images that exemplify their meanings à la Rosetta Stone [2] and Duo Lingo [3] .
1	  The approach is grounded in control theory and capitalizes on recent work by [4] , [5] that frames the “teaching” problem as that of finding approximately optimal teaching policies for approximately optimal learners (AOTAOL).
2     Our work expands on [4] , [5] in several ways: (1) We develop a novel student model in which the teacher's actions can partially eliminate hypotheses about the curriculum.
2     (2) With our student model, inference can be conducted analytically rather than numerically, thus allowing computationally efficient planning to optimize learning.
1	  (3) We develop a reinforcement learning-based hierarchical control technique that allows the teaching policy to search through deeper learning trajectories.
2     We demonstrate our approach in a novel ITS for foreign language learning similar to Rosetta Stone and show that the automatically generated AOTAOL teaching policy performs favorably compared to two hand-crafted teaching policies.

1	  In this paper we present a software platform called Chatbot designed to introduce high school students to Computer Science (CS) concepts in an innovative way: by programming chatbots.
1	  A chatbot is a bot that can be programmed to have a conversation with a human or robotic partner in some natural language such as English or Spanish.
1     While programming their chatbots, students use fundamental CS constructs such as variables, conditionals, and finite state automata, among others.
1     Chatbot uses pattern matching, state of the art lemmatization techniques, and finite state automata in order to provide automatic formative assessment to the students.
1	  When an error is found, the formative feedback generated is immediate and task-level.
1     We evaluated Chatbot in two observational studies.
1     An online nation-wide competition where more than 10,000 students participated.
1	  And, a mandatory in-class 15-lesson pilot course in three high schools.
2	  We measured indicators of student engagement (task completion, participation, self reported interest, etc.) and found that girls' engagement with Chatbot was higher than boys' for most indicators.
2     Also, in the online competition, the task completion rate for the students that decided to use Chatbot was five times higher than for the students that chose to use the renowned animation and game programming tool Alice.
2     Our results suggest that the availability of automatic formative assessment may have an impact on task completion and other engagement indicators among high school students.

#### Automatic Chinese Multiple Choice Question Generation Using Mixed Similarity Strategy


0	  Automatic question generation can help teachers to save the time necessary for constructing examination papers.
0	  Several approaches were proposed to automatically generate multiple-choice questions for vocalbuary assessment or grammar exercises.
0     However, most of these studies focused on generating questions in English with a certain similarity strategy.
1     This paper presents a mixed similarity strategy which generates Chinese multiple choice distractors with a statistical regression model including orthographic, phonological and semantic features, i.e., features that were shown in previous psycholinguistics studies to contribute to character recognition.
1	  In a first experiment, we evaluated the predictive power of the proposed features in measuring Chinese character similarity.
2	  One of the significant experimental results showed that the combination of the four proposed categories of features (structure, semantic radical, stroke and meaning) accounts for 62.5 percent of the variance in the human judgments of character similarity.
1	  In the second experiment, a user study was conducted to evaluate the quality of system-generated questions using a test item analysis method.
1	  Two hundred ninety-six Chinese primary school students (10-11-year-old) participated in this study.
1	  We have compared the mixed strategy with another three common distractor generation strategies, orthographic strategy, semantic strategy, and phonological strategy.
2     One of important findings suggested that the mixed strategy significantly outperformed other three strategies in terms of the distractor usefulness and has a highest discrimination power among four strategies.

#### Learning Buckets: Helping Teachers Introduce Flexibility in the Management of Learning Artifacts Across Spaces


0	  Technology offers rich opportunities for learning across different physical and virtual spaces.
0	  However, most of current across-spaces proposals are either highly teacher-centered, inflexible in the students' self-management of learning artifacts during the enactment, or allow the teacher little/no control of such students' management of artifacts.
0	  Moreover, these proposals tend to be disconnected from the practices and tools that are usual in the classroom.
0	  How can we achieve a middle ground between keeping the teacher in control of across-spaces situations and, at the same time, providing students with a degree of flexibility to manage learning artifacts?
1     Aiming to address such a challenge we propose the notion of learning bucket, and the Bucket-Server, a system implementing such a notion.
1     A learning bucket is a container of learning artifacts which are generated and/or accessed across-spaces by the students during the enactment, according to constraints configured by teachers at design time.
1     The responsive evaluation conducted, based on a feature analysis and a pilot study with experts, suggests that learning buckets can help evolve from teacher- to student-centered approaches, while maintaining the teacher in control of students' actions.
2     The evaluation also indicates that the Bucket-Server surpasses the support provided by alternative proposals to across-spaces learning.

#### Orchestration Load Indicators and Patterns: In-the-Wild Studies Using Mobile Eye-Tracking


0	  Orchestration load is the effort a teacher spends in coordinating multiple activities and learning processes.
0	  It has been proposed as a construct to evaluate the usability of learning technologies at the classroom level, in the same way that cognitive load is used as a measure of usability at the individual level.
0     However, so far this notion has remained abstract.
1	  In order to ground orchestration load in empirical evidence and study it in a more systematic and detailed manner, we propose a method to quantify it, based on physiological data (concretely, mobile eye-tracking measures), along with human-coded behavioral data.
1	  This paper presents the results of applying this method to four exploratory case studies, where four teachers orchestrated technology-enhanced face-to-face lessons with primary, secondary school, and university students.
2     The data from these studies provide a first validation of this method in different conditions, and illustrate how it can be used to understand the effect of different classroom factors on orchestration load.
2     From these studies, we also extract empirical insights about classroom orchestration using technology.

#### Using the Tablet Gestures and Speech of Pairs of Students to Classify Their Collaboration


0	  Effective collaboration between student peers is not spontaneous.
0	  A system that can measure collaboration in real-time may be useful, as it could alert an instructor to pairs that need help in collaborating effectively.
1	  We tested whether superficial measures of speech and user interface actions would suffice for measuring collaboration.
1	  Pairs of students solved complex math problems while data were collected in the form of verbal interaction and user action logs from the students' tablets.
1	  We distinguished four classifications of interactivity: collaboration, cooperation, high asymmetric contribution and low asymmetric contribution.
1	  Human coders used richer data (several video streams) to choose one of these codes for each episode.
1	  Thousands of features were extracted computationally from the log and audio data.
1	  Machine learning was used to induce a detector that also assigned a code to each episode as a function of these features.
1	  Detectors for combinations of codes were induced as well.
2     The best detector's overall accuracy was 96 percent (kappa = 0.92) compared to human coding.
2     This high level of agreement suggests that superficial features of speech and log data do suffice for measuring collaboration.
2     However, these results should be viewed as preliminary because the particular task may have made it relatively easy to distinguish collaboration from cooperation.

#### Mining Online Discussion Data for Understanding Teachers Reflective Thinking


0	  Teachers' online discussion text data shed light on their reflective thinking.
0	  With the growing scale of text data, the traditional way of manual coding, however, has been challenged.
0     In order to process the large-scale unstructured text data, it is necessary to integrate the inductive content analysis method and educational data mining techniques.
1	  An inductive content analysis on samples taken from 17,624 posts was implemented and the categories of teachers' reflective thinking were obtained.
1	  Based on the results of inductive content analysis, we implemented a single-label text classification algorithm to classify the sample data.
1	  Then, we applied the trained classification model on a large-scale and unexplored online discussion text data set and two types of visualizations of the results were provided.
1	  By using the categories gained from inductive content analysis to create a radar map, teachers' reflection level was represented.
1	  In addition, a cumulative adjacency matrix was created to characterize the evolution of teachers' reflective thinking.
2     This study could partly explain how teachers reflected in online professional learning environments and brought awareness to educational policy makers, teacher training managers, and education researchers.

#### Evaluating Cognitive and Affective Outcomes of a Digital Game-Based Math Test


0	  Even though digital learning games have become common in education, relatively little is known about the usefulness of game-based assessment.
0	  This paper aims to explore if a game-based math test can provide added value to math education with respect to cognitive and affective outcomes.
1	  We used in-game measures, embedded in the game called Semideus Exam, focusing on conceptual fraction knowledge.
1	  In order to validate the game-based assessment approach, we compared the cognitive outcomes of 51 Finnish sixth graders, who completed both paper-based and game-based math tests in a randomized order.
1	  In addition, the students' test anxiety and flow experience were measured to evaluate the affective outcomes.
2     The results indicate that the game-based test scores correlated significantly with the paper-based test scores suggesting that the game-based assessment was successfully implemented and the game provided comparable data with the paper-based test approach.
2     More importantly, the results revealed that game-based assessment lowered test anxiety and increased engagement which is likely to decrease assessment bias caused by test anxiety.
2     In addition, the results show that earlier playing experience and gender did not influence the game-based test score suggesting fairness of the game-based assessment approach.
2     Although we identified several benefits of the game-based assessment approach, more evidence is needed on the usefulness and fairness of game-based assessments.

#### From Learners to Earners: Enabling MOOC Learners to Apply Their Skills and Earn Money in an Online Market Place


0	  Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) aim to educate the world.
0	  More often than not, however, MOOCs fall short of this goal-a majority of learners are already highly educated (with a Bachelor's degree or more) and come from specific parts of the (developed) world.
0     Learners from developing countries without a higher degree are underrepresented, though desired, in MOOCs.
0     One reason for those learners to drop out of a course can be found in their financial realities and the subsequent limited amount of time they can dedicate to a course besides earning a living.
0     If we could pay learners to take a MOOC, this hurdle would largely disappear.
0	  With MOOCS, this leads to the following fundamental challenge: How can learners be paid at scale?
0	  Ultimately, we envision a recommendation engine that recommends tasks from online market places such as Upwork or witmart to learners, that are relevant to the course content of the MOOC.
0	  In this manner, the learners learn and earn money.
1	  To investigate the feasibility of this vision, in this paper, we explored to what extent (1) online market places contain tasks relevant to a specific MOOC, and (2) learners are able to solve real-world tasks correctly and with sufficient quality.
2     Finally, based on our experimental design, we were also able to investigate the impact of real-world bonus tasks in a MOOC on the general learner population.

#### A Multimodal Assessment Framework for Integrating Student Writing and Drawing in Elementary Science Learning


0	  Science learning is inherently multimodal, with students utilizing both drawings and writings to explain observations of physical phenomena.
0	  As such assessments in science should accommodate the many ways students express their understanding, especially given evidence that understanding is distributed across both drawing and writing.
0     In recent years advanced automated assessment techniques that evaluate expressive student artifacts have emerged.
0     However, these techniques have largely operated individually, each considering only a single mode.
1	  We propose a framework for the multimodal automated assessment of students' writing and drawing to leverage the synergies inherent across modalities and create a more complete and accurate picture of a student's knowledge.
1	  We introduce a multimodal assessment framework as well as two computational techniques for automatically analyzing student writings and drawings: a convolutional neural network-based model for assessing student writing, and a topology-based model for assessing student drawing.
2	  Evaluations with elementary students' writings and drawings collected with a tablet-based digital science notebook demonstrate that 1) each of the framework's two modalities provide an independent and complementary measure of student science learning, and 2) the computational methods are capable of accurately assessing student work from both modalities and offer the potential for integration in technology-rich learning environments for real-time formative assessment.

#### Adaptive Gamification for Learning Environments


0	  In spite of their effectiveness, learning environments often fail to engage users and end up under-used.
0	  Many studies show that gamification of learning environments can enhance learners' motivation to use learning environments.
0	  However, learners react differently to specific game mechanics and little is known about how to adapt gaming features to learners' profiles.
1	  In this paper, we propose a process for adapting gaming features based on a player model.
1	  This model is inspired from existing player typologies and types of gamification elements.
1	  Our approach is implemented in a learning environment with five different gaming features, and evaluated with 266 participants.
2     The main results of this study show that, amongst the most engaged learners (i.e., learners who use the environment the longest), those with adapted gaming features spend significantly more time in the learning environment.
2     Furthermore, learners with features that are not adapted have a higher level of amotivation.
2     These results support the relevance of adapting gaming features to enhance learners' engagement, and provide cues on means to implement adaptation mechanisms.

#### Automatic Question Tagging with Deep Neural Networks


0	  In recent years, computerized adaptive testing (CAT) has gained popularity as an important means to evaluate students' ability.
0	  Assigning tags to test questions is crucial in CAT.
0     Manual tagging is widely used for constructing question banks; however, this approach is time-consuming and might lead to consistency issues.
0	  Automatic question tagging, an alternative, has not been studied extensively.
1	  In this paper, we propose a position-based attention model and keywords-based model to automatically tag questions with knowledge units.
1	  With regard to multiple-choice questions, the proposed models employ mechanisms to capture useful information from keywords to enhance tagging performance.
1	  Unlike traditional machine learning-based tagging methods, our models utilize deep neural networks to represent questions using contextual information.
2     The experimental results show that our proposed models outperform some traditional classification and topic methods by a large margin on an English question bank dataset.

#### Early Detection Prediction of Learning Outcomes in Online Short-Courses via Learning Behaviors


1	  We study learning outcome prediction for online courses.
0	  Whereas prior work has focused on semester-long courses with frequent student assessments, we focus on short-courses that have single outcomes assigned by instructors at the end.
0	  The lack of performance data and generally small enrollments makes the behavior of learners, captured as they interact with course content and with one another in Social Learning Networks (SLN), essential for prediction.
1	  Our method defines several (machine) learning features based on the processing of behaviors collected on the modes of (human) learning in a course, and uses them in appropriate classifiers.
2     Through evaluation on data captured from three two-week courses hosted through our delivery platforms, we make three key observations: (i) behavioral data contains signals predictive of learning outcomes in short-courses (with classifiers achieving AUCs ≥ 0.8 after the two weeks), (ii) early detection is possible within the first week (AUCs ≥ 0.7 with the first week of data), and (iii) the content features have an “earliest” detection capability (with higher AUC in the first few days), while the SLN features become the more predictive set over time as the network matures.
2     We also discuss how our method can generate behavioral analytics for instructors.

#### From Study Tactics to Learning Strategies: An Analytical Method for Extracting Interpretable Representations


0	  Research into self-regulated learning has traditionally relied upon self-reported data.
0	  While there is a rich body of literature that has extracted invaluable information from such sources, it suffers from a number of shortcomings.
0	  For instance, it has been shown that surveys often provide insight into students' perceptions about learning rather than how students actually employ study tactics and learning strategies.
0	  Accordingly, recent research has sought to assess students' learning strategies and, by extension, their self-regulated learning via trace data collected from digital learning environments.
0     A number of studies have amply demonstrated the ability of educational data mining and learning analytics methods to identify patterns indicative of learning strategies within trace log data.
0     However, many of these methods are limited in their ability to describe and interpret differences between extracted latent representations at varying levels of granularity (for instance, in terms of the underlying data of student actions and behavior).
1     To address this limitation, the present study proposes a new methodology whereby interpretable representations of student's self-regulating behavior are derived at two theoretically inspired levels: that of learning strategies, and the study tactics that compose them.

#### Implementing On-Call-Tutor System for Facilitating Peer-Help Activities


1	  In this study, we developed an on-call-tutor system to facilitate peer-help activities.
1	  The system was implemented in a face-to-face heterogeneous classroom with 119 students from different departments who were not familiar with each other.
1	  Students learned Geographic Information System (GIS) in a computer classroom in two groups: students, who learned without our on-call-tutor system, were in a control group whereas those, who learned with our on-call-tutor system, were in an experimental group.
1	  When students had any difficulties during the learning process (e.g., to use GIS), they could request help face-to-face (the control group) or through the system (the experimental group).
1	  When students requested help via the system, it selected one student from a pool of those who perceived himself/herself to have excellent learning progress and then assigned him/her as a tutor to a student in need (tutee).
1	  We carried out this study to explore whether our on-call-tutor system is useful to facilitate peer-help activities and to enhance student learning performance.
1	  To this end, based on the theoretical framework of this study, we designed an experiment in which learning performance and behavior of students in the two groups were explored and compared.
1	  We also analyzed student social network and investigated whether it can be extended with the support of the on-call-tutor system.
1	  Finally, factors that influence making a friend with an unfamiliar classmate and relationship among these factors were explored.
1	  For the data analysis, we gathered student logs to send messages, to help peers, and their practice time.
1	  We also collected students' responses to a questionnaire survey about their attitudes towards using our on-call-tutor system.
1	  In addition, student learning performance was measured and interviews with students were carried out.
2     Our results showed that, compared to students in the control group, those in the experimental group had more peer-help activities and better learning performance.
2     Results also showed that students built their social network in which they interacted with each other and obtained/provided social support and useful knowledge for learning purpose.
2     In addition, we found that usefulness of our system for learning was the main factor that influenced students' willingness to build friendship in the social network with familiar/unfamiliar classmates and then communicate with them.
2     Based on our results, we suggest employing the on-call-tutor system in a heterogeneously grouped classroom in order to facilitate peer-help activities, especially when students learn difficult subjects like computer software and are not acquainted with one another.
2     Our system is useful for students in requesting help and finding a tutor in case when they need assistance or some further learning information.
2     With the assistance of our system, students can build the social network among classmates and communicate with each other in order to find/provide learning assistance and social support.
2     As a result, student peer-help activities can be facilitated and learning performance enhanced.

#### Personalized Affective Feedback to Address Students’ Frustration in ITS


0	  The importance of affective states in learning has led many Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) to include students' affective states in their learner models.
0	  The adaptation and hence the benefits of an ITS can be improved by detecting and responding to students' affective states.
0	  In prior work, we have created and validated a theory-driven model for detecting students' frustration, as well as identifying its causes as students interact with the ITS.
1	  In this paper, we present a strategy to respond to students' frustration by offering motivational messages that address different causes of frustration.
1     Based on attribution theory, these messages are created to praise the student's effort, attribute the results to the identified cause, show sympathy for failure or obtain feedback from the students.
1	  We implemented our approach in three schools where students interacted with the ITS.
1	  Data from 188 students from the three schools collected across two weeks was used for our analysis.
2     The results suggest that the frustration instances reduced significantly statistically (p <; 0:05), due to the motivational messages.
2     This study suggests that motivational messages that use attribution theory and address the reason for frustration reduce the number of frustration instances per session.

#### MOOCs as a Remedial Complement: Students’ Adoption and Learning Outcomes


0	  The effectiveness of remedial mathematics courses in post-secondary education has been a controversial topic for years.
0	  Higher Education institutions need their students to have basic understandings of the subjects to be imparted in the first semesters, but since they come with different backgrounds and prior knowledge, this is not always possible and many students struggle in their first courses.
1	  This paper presents the results of students' adoption and learning outcomes of using four MOOCs as a complementary study resource for an on-campus calculus diagnostic exam.
1	  Over 700 newly admitted university students had to take a mandatory diagnostic exam on four calculus topics before classes started.
1	  MOOCs were proposed as a voluntary support for studying these subjects.
1	  Following a mixed method analysis, we studied why and when the students used the online courses and we also measured the effects of its use in terms of the students' diagnostic exam grades and learning outcomes.
2     The results show that students mostly used the MOOCs to study the subjects that were not covered in their secondary studies.
2     Students who were active in these course topics obtained better scores, having more chances of passing the diagnostic exam than students who did not study with the MOOCs.
2     Furthermore, students not only used the MOOCs for studying for the exam, but also for refreshing concepts for future courses.

#### Developing Early Detectors of Student Attrition and Wheel Spinning Using Deep Learning


0	  The increased usage of computer-based learning platforms and online tools in classrooms presents new opportunities to not only study the underlying constructs involved in the learning process, but also use this information to identify and aid struggling students.
0	  Many learning platforms, particularly those driving or supplementing instruction, are only able to provide aid to students who interact with the system.
0     With this in mind, student persistence emerges as a prominent learning construct contributing to students success when learning new material.
0     Conversely, high persistence is not always productive for students, where additional practice does not help the student move toward a state of mastery of the material.
1     In this paper, we apply a transfer learning methodology using deep learning and traditional modeling techniques to study high and low representations of unproductive persistence.
1     We focus on two prominent problems in the fields of educational data mining and learner analytics representing low persistence, characterized as student “stopout,” and unproductive high persistence, operationalized through student “wheel spinning,” in an effort to better understand the relationship between these measures of unproductive persistence (i.e., stopout and wheel spinning) and develop early detectors of these behaviors.
2	  We find that models developed to detect each within and across-assignment stopout and wheel spinning are able to learn sets of features that generalize to predict the other.
2     We further observe how these models perform at each learning opportunity within student assignments to identify when interventions may be deployed to best aid students who are likely to exhibit unproductive persistence.

#### A Quest for a One-Size-Fits-All Neural Network: Early Prediction of Students at Risk in Online Courses


0	  A significant amount of research effort has been put into finding variables that can identify students at risk based on activity records available in learning management systems (LMS).
0	  These variables often depend on the context, for example, the course structure, how the activities are assessed or whether the course is entirely online or a blended course.
0     To the best of our knowledge, a predictive model that can generalize well to many different types of courses using data available in the LMS does not currently exist in the learning analytics literature.
1     In this study, early prediction of students at risk is tackled by training a number of neural networks to predict which students would likely submit their assignments on time based on their activity up to two days before assignments' due dates.
1     Five different datasets that cover a total of 78 722 student enrolments in 5487 courses have been used in this study.
1     In order to improve how well the neural networks generalize, our networks can perform different forms of feature engineering using course peers data.
1	  The different architectures of these networks have been compared to find the one with more predictive power.
1	  To validate the models trained from the networks, both new datasets and unseen examples extracted from the same datasets have been used for training.
2     Our research show that adding contextual information results in better prediction accuracies and F1 scores.

#### How Widely Can Prediction Models Be Generalized? Performance Prediction in Blended Courses


0	  Blended courses that mix in-person instruction with online platforms are increasingly common in secondary education.
0	  These platforms record a rich amount of data on students' study habits and social interactions.
0     Prior research has shown that these metrics are correlated with students performance in face-to-face classes.

1	  In this paper, we use data from two offerings of two different undergraduate courses to train and evaluate predictive models of student performance based on persistent student characteristics including study habits and social interactions.
1	  We analyze the performance of these models on the same offering, on different offerings of the same course, and across courses to see how well they generalize.
1	  We also evaluate the models on different segments of the courses to determine how early reliable predictions can be made.
2     This paper tells us in part how much data is required to make robust predictions and how cross-class data may be used, or not, to boost model performance.
2     The results of this study will help us better understand how similar the study habits, social activities, and the teamwork styles are across semesters for students in each performance category.
2     These trained models also provide an avenue to improve our existing support platforms to better support struggling students early in the semester with the goal of providing timely intervention.

#### Interpretable Multiview Early Warning System Adapted to Underrepresented Student Populations


0	  Early warning systems have been progressively implemented in higher education institutions to predict student performance.
0	  However, they usually fail at effectively integrating the many information sources available at universities to make more accurate and timely predictions, they often lack decision-making reasoning to motivate the reasons behind the predictions, and they are generally biased toward the general student body, ignoring the idiosyncrasies of underrepresented student populations (determined by socio-demographic factors such as race, gender, residency, or status as a freshmen, transfer, adult, or first-generation students) that traditionally have greater difficulties and performance gaps.
1	  This paper presents a multiview early warning system built with comprehensible Genetic Programming classification rules adapted to specifically target underrepresented and underperforming student populations.
1	  The system integrates many student information repositories using multiview learning to improve the accuracy and timing of the predictions.
1     Three interfaces have been developed to provide personalized and aggregated comprehensible feedback to students, instructors, and staff to facilitate early intervention and student support.
2     Experimental results, validated with statistical analysis, indicate that this multiview learning approach outperforms traditional classifiers.
2     Learning outcomes will help instructors and policy-makers to deploy strategies to increase retention and improve academics.

#### Multiview Learning for Early Prognosis of Academic Performance: A Case Study


0	  Educational data mining has gained a lot of attention among scientists in recent years and constitutes an efficient tool for unraveling the concealed knowledge in educational data.
0	  Recently, semisupervised learning methods have been gradually implemented in the educational process demonstrating their usability and effectiveness.
0     Cotraining is a representative semisupervised method aiming to exploit both labeled and unlabeled examples, provided that each example is described by two features views.
0     Nevertheless, it is yet to be used in various scientific fields, among which the educational field as well, since the assumption about the existence of two feature views cannot be easily put into practice.
1	  Within this context, the main purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of a proposed cotraining method for early prognosis of undergraduate students' performance in the final examinations of a distance course based on a plethora of attributes which are naturally divided into two distinct views, since they are originated from different sources.
1	  More specifically, the first view consists of attributes regarding students' characteristics and academic achievements which are manually filled out by their tutors, whereas the second one consists of attributes tracking students' online activity in the course learning management system and which are automatically recorded by the system.
2     The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed cotraining method as opposed to state-of-the-art semisupervised and supervised methods.

#### Predicting the Risk of Academic Dropout With Temporal Multi-Objective Optimization


0	  In the European academic systems, the public funding to single universities depends on many factors, which are periodically evaluated.
0	  One of such factors is the rate of success, that is, the rate of students that do complete their course of study.
0     At many levels, therefore, there is an increasing interest in being able to predict the risk that a student will abandon the studies, so that (specific, personal) corrective actions may be designed.
1     In this paper, we propose an innovative temporal optimization model that is able to identify the earliest moment in a student's career in which a reliable prediction can be made concerning his/her risk of dropping out from the course of studies.
2     Unlike most available models, our solution can be based on the academic behavior alone, and our evidence suggests that by ignoring classically used attributes such as the gender or the results of pre-academic studies one obtains more accurate, and less biased, models.
1	  We tested our system on real data from the three-year degree in computer science offered by the University of Ferrara (Italy).

#### Feature Extraction for Next-Term Prediction of Poor Student Performance


0	  Developing tools to support students and learning in a traditional or online setting is a significant task in today's educational environment.
0	  The initial steps toward enabling such technologies using machine learning techniques focused on predicting the student's performance in terms of the achieved grades.
0     However, these approaches do not perform as well in predicting poor-performing students.
0     The objective of our work is twofold.
1     First, in order to overcome this limitation, we explore if poorly performing students can be more accurately predicted by formulating the problem as binary classification, based on data provided before the start of the semester.
1	  Second, in order to gain insights as to which are the factors that can lead to poor performance, we engineered a number of human-interpretable features that quantify these factors.
1	  These features were derived from the students' grades from the University of Minnesota, an undergraduate public institution.
1	  Based on these features, we perform a study to identify different student groups of interest, while at the same time, identify their importance.
2     As the resulting models provide us with different subsets of correct predictions, their combination can boost the overall performance.

#### An Early Feedback Prediction System for Learners At-Risk Within a First-Year Higher Education Course


0	  Identifying at-risk students as soon as possible is a challenge in educational institutions.
0	  Decreasing the time lag between identification and real at-risk state may significantly reduce the risk of failure or disengage.
0     In small courses, their identification is relatively easy, but it is impractical on larger ones.
0     Current Learning Management Systems store a large amount of data that could help to generate predictive models to early identification of students in online and blended learning.
1     The contribution of this paper is twofold: First, a new adaptive predictive model is presented based only on students' grades specifically trained for each course.
1	  A deep analysis is performed in the whole institution to evaluate its performance accuracy.
1	  Second, an early warning system is developed, focusing on dashboards visualization for stakeholders (i.e., students and teachers) and an early feedback prediction system to intervene in the case of at-risk identification.
1	  The early warning system has been evaluated in a case study on a first-year undergraduate course in computer science.
2     We show the accuracy of the correct identification of at-risk students, the students' appraisal, and the most common factors that lead to at-risk level.

#### From Lab to Production: Lessons Learnt and Real-Life Challenges of an Early Student-Dropout Prevention System


0	  This paper presents the work done to support student dropout risk prevention in a real online e-learning environment: A Spanish distance university with thousands of undergraduate students.
0	  The main goal is to prevent students from abandoning the university by means of retention actions focused on the most at-risk students, trying to maximize the effectiveness of institutional efforts in this direction.
1	  With this purpose, we generated predictive models based on the C5.0 algorithm using data from more than 11,000 students collected along five years.
1     Then, we developed SPA (Sistema de Predicciæn de Abandono, dropout prediction system in Spanish), an early warning system that uses these models to generate static early dropout-risk predictions and dynamic periodically updated ones.
1     It also supports the recording of the resulting retention-oriented interventions for further analysis.
1     SPA is in production since 2017 and is currently in its fourth semester of continuous use.
1     It has calculated more than 117,000 risk scores to predict the dropout risk of more than 5700 students.
1     About 13,000 retention actions have been recorded.
2     The white-box predictive models used in production provided reasonably good results, very close to those obtained in the laboratory.
2     On the way from research to production, we faced several challenges that needed to be effectively addressed in order to be successful.
2	  In this paper, we share the challenges faced and the lessons learnt during this process.
2     We hope this helps those who wish to cross the road from predictive modeling with potential value to the exploitation of complete dropout prevention systems that provide sustained value in real production scenarios.

#### Pedagogical Intervention Practices: Improving Learning Engagement Based on Early Prediction


0	  Most educational institutions adopted the hybrid teaching mode through learning management systems.
0	  The logging data/clickstream could describe learners' online behavior.
0     Many researchers have used them to predict students' performance, which has led to a diverse set of findings, but how to use insights from captured data to enhance learning engagement is an open question.
0     Furthermore, identifying students at risk of failure is only the first step in truly addressing this issue.
0     It is important to create actionable predictive model in the real-world contexts to design interventions.
1	  In this paper, we first extracted features from students' learning activities and study habits to predict students' performance in the Kung Fu style competency education.
1	  Then, we proposed a TrAdaBoost-based transfer learning model, which was pretrained using the data of the former course iteration and applied to the current course iteration.
2     Our results showed that the generalization ability of the prediction model across the teaching iterations is high, and the model can achieve relatively high precision even when the new data are not sufficient to train a model alone.
2     This work helped in timely intervention toward the at-risk students.
1	  In addition, two intervention experiments with split-test were conducted separately in Fall 2017 and Summer 2018.
2     The statistical tests showed that both behavior-based reminding intervention and error-related recommending intervention that based on early prediction played a positive role in improving the blended learning engagement.

#### Context-Aware Learning in Physics Experiments


0	  Smart Glasses such as Google Glass are mobile computers combining classical Head-Mounted Displays (HMD) with several sensors.
0	  Therefore, contact-free, sensor-based experiments can be linked with relating, near-eye presented multiple representations.
0     We will present a first approach on how Smart Glasses can be used as an experimental tool for head-centered, context-aware, wearable-technology-enhanced, and inquiry-based learning in physics education.
1	  Therefore, we developed an app that is based on the Google Glass platform and designed to perform educational physical experiments on the topic of acoustics.
1	  Its initial application is intended for high-school students whose task is to study the relationship between the frequency of the sound generated by hitting a glass of water and the amount of water in the glass.
1	  The core idea is to have Google Glass automatically measure both the water fill level with the camera and the sound frequency with the microphone, and incrementally generate a fill level/frequency graph in the HMD.
1	  We designed an educational setting and studied its effect on cognitive and affective variables with an intervention-control-group design.
1	  While the intervention group analyzed the fill level/frequency relationship with the Google Glass platform, control group 1 worked on the phenomenon using the same platform implemented on a tablet PC.
1	  Control group 2 analyzed the phenomenon using a tablet PC with a typical mobile-based education platform.
1	  We used a two-way ANCOVA to study learning outcome, wondering, curiosity, cognitive load, and experimentation time as dependent variables of 46 high-school eighth-graders together with group membership and gender influence as independent variables.
2	  While the positive effects of using Google Glass as a mobile lab on wondering and curiosity as well as a positive trend for experimentation time were detected, no differences were analyzed for learning achievement.
2     Although students have a higher cognitive load when working with Google Glass compared to other devices, the cognitive load level is very low in general.

#### Enhancing Physical Education with Exergames and Wearable Technology


0	  Increases in the numbers of obese and overweight children are a major issue in post-industrial societies because obesity can lead to severe health-related problems.
0	  In addition, many challenges affect the quantity and quality of physical education (PE) provided by schools.
0	  Exergames that combine exercise with gaming have been recognized as a possible method for motivating children to become physically active and to make PE more fun.
0     Furthermore, exergames that utilize wearable sensors devices allow players' movements to be tracked for estimating the efficiency of exercise.
1	  In this study, we developed the Running Othello 2 (RO2) exergame, where players wear a smartphone and a smart wrist band to compete in a board game enhanced with physical and pedagogical missions.
1	  In physical missions, the game uses inertial sensors and a heart rate meter to detect the physical activities of players.
1	  The pedagogical part of the game is based on the South Korean PE curriculum.
1	  We evaluated RO2 with 61 South Korean third grade elementary school students, 32 of whom learned curriculum topics by playing the game.
1	  The other 29 students comprised a control group who studied the pedagogical content using handouts.
2     The results indicated that learning with RO2 was more efficient, the players were engaged, and their heart rates increased.
2     Based on the evaluation, we identified several issues to be addressed in future research.
2	  Finally, we discussed how RO2 supports the educational affordances of wearables and we explained how exergames using wearables can overcome some of the challenges faced by PE.

#### Representing and Reconciling Personal Data and Experience in a Wearable Technology Gaming Project


0	  Extant literature has largely not examined how users critically engage with their physical activity monitors, as objective data sense-making is often deemed superior to users' subjective realities.
0	  Our research, however, examines how middle-school youth encounter the representation of their data, as it is converted and actionable in an online game.
0     This ethnographic study illustrates how youth negotiate conflicts between their data and embodied experience.
1	  Using a grounded theory approach, our analysis of interviews and focus groups reveals emergent categories of resistance such as youth evaluating the incompatibility of the device, disputing the device's step-count accuracy and syncing, and disputing the game's conversion of steps.
1     In particular, we highlight the ways youth sometimes privileged their embodied recollections over the device's seemingly accurate data.
1     The article also provides a case of a day during implementation when youth converged on a single form of resistance, game conversion, and examines their reasoning and alternate forms of data validation that we saw in-action on that day.
2     Finally, we discuss benefits to learning and critical engagement that result from users' disputes and conclude by positing the promise in designing physical activity monitors for engagement, instead of exclusively persuasion or reward.

#### Appropriating Quantified Self Technologies to Support Elementary Statistical Teaching and Learning


0	  Wearable activity tracking devices associated with the Quantified Self movement have potential benefit for educational settings because they produce authentic and granular data about activities and experiences already familiar to youth.
0	  This article explores how that potential could be realized through explicit acknowledgment of and response to tacit design assumptions about how such technologies will be used in practice and strategic design for use in a classroom.
0     We argue that particular practical adaptations that we have identified serve to ensure that the classroom and educational use cases are appropriately considered.
1	  As an example of how those adaptations are realized in actual elementary classrooms, we describe an effort to provide fifth-grade students each with their own Fitbit activity trackers in the context of a multi-week unit exploring core ideas in elementary statistics.
1	  Observational descriptions and transcript excerpts of students and teachers discussing their own Fitbit data are presented to illustrate what opportunities exist to leverage youth familiarity with daily activities in a way that targets development of statistical thinking.
2	  Quantitative written test results showing learning gains and differences between traditional and wearable device-enhanced instruction are also presented.
2     Improvement on several statistical thinking constructs is identified, including in the areas of data display, conceptions of statistics, modeling variability, and informal inference.

#### Introducing IoT and Wearable Technologies into Task-Based Language Learning for Young Children


0	  In the last few years, in an attempt to further motivate students to learn a foreign language, there has been an increasing interest in task-based teaching techniques, which emphasize communication and the practical use of language, thus moving away from the repetitive grammar-translation methods.
0	  Within this approach, the significance of situating foreign language learners in scenarios where they can meaningfully learn has become a major priority for many educators.
0	  This approach is particularly relevant in the context of teaching foreign languages to young children, who need to be introduced to a new language by means of very concrete vocabulary, which is facilitated by the use of objects that they can handle and see.
1	  In this study, we investigate the benefits of using wearable and Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies in streamlining the creation of such realistic task-based language learning scenarios.
2     We show that the use of these technologies will prove beneficial by freeing the instructors of having to keep records of the tasks performed by each student during the class session.
2     Instead, instructors can focus their efforts on creating a friendly environment and encouraging students to participate.
2     Our study sets up a basis for showing the great benefits of using wearable and IoT technologies in streamlining 1) the creation of realistic scenarios in which young foreign language learners can feel comfortable engaging in chat and becoming better prepared for social interaction in a foreign language, and 2) the acquisition and processing of performance metrics.

0	  This study examines learning by making by students to explore STEM using a constructionist approach with a particular focus on computer science and engineering.
0	  The use of IoT as a technology enhanced learning (TEL) tool created the learning conditions to be studied: (a) collaborative: no one person had the knowledge to complete the project alone, (b) problem-based: no off the shelf solution was used, and (c) multidisciplinary: the learning context pushed the boundaries across the subjects.

1	  This work presents a methodology to create effective laboratories for learning that interact with a Learning Management System (LMS) to achieve advanced integration.
1     It is based on pedagogical aspects and considers not only the laboratory application itself but also related resources that complement it.
1     The methodology is flexible, covers all possible cases, and it is structured in stages that can be used with any system architecture, standards, or type of online laboratory (virtual, remote, or hybrid) because it abstracts technical aspects at a high level.
2     This methodology facilitates the creation of new online labs so that any teacher, even those without specialized knowledge, can clarify many of the questions that may arise and gain understanding of how to implement an effective online laboratory with LMS integration to assist learning.
2	  As an example and validation of the methodology, this work describes a laboratory developed as a Shared Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) package which is hosted in the institutional LMS at the University of Jaen.

#### A Debate and Decision-Making Tool for Enhanced Learning


0	  Debates have been used to develop critical thinking within teaching environments.
0	  Many learning activities are configured as working groups, which use debates to make decisions.
0     Nevertheless, in a classroom debate, only a few students can participate; large work groups are similarly limited.
0     Whilst the use of web tools would appear to offer a convenient solution, none of those currently available provides an automated system for organizing contributions into a logical structure, or for making decisions.
1	  To address this problem, this paper describes a new tool for managing and structuring debates over the Internet, and presents the results of a series of trials in an educational context.
1	  The tool enables users to post opinions and proposals, and to make multiple group decisions.
2	  The main advantages are that it does not require a moderator, and all contributions are automatically arranged into an intuitive structure.
2     Thus, it enabled large groups to carry out bigger projects.
2     Empirical results showed that it also encouraged the involvement of all the students in debates and allowed the participation of each student to be evaluated.

#### Analyzing the Impact of Using Optional Activities in Self-Regulated Learning


0	  Self-regulated learning (SRL) environments provide students with activities to improve their learning (e.g., by solving exercises), but they might also provide optional activities (e.g., changing an avatar image or setting goals) where students can decide whether they would like to use or do them and how.
0	  Few works have dealt with the use of optional activities in SRL environments.
1	  This paper thus analyzes the use of optional activities in two case studies with a SRL approach.
2     We found that the level of use of optional activites was low with only 23.1 percent of students making use of some functionality, while the level of use of learning activities was higher.
2     Optional activities which are not related to learning are used more.
2     We also explored the behavior of students using some of the optional activities in the courses such as setting goals and voting comments, finding that students finished the goals they set in more than 50 percent of the time and that they voted their peers' comments in a positive way.
2     We also found that gender and the type of course can influence which optional activities are used.
2     Moreover, the relations of the use of optional activities with proficient exercises and learning gains is low when taking out third variables, but we believe that optional activities might motivate students and produce better learning in an indirect way.

#### Early Prediction of Student Profiles Based on Performance and Gaming Preferences


0	  State of the art research shows that gamified learning can be used to engage students and help them perform better.
0	  However, most studies use a one-size-fits-all approach to gamification, where individual differences and needs are ignored.
0	  In a previous study, we identified four types of students attending a gamified college course, characterized by different levels of performance, engagement and behavior.
1	  In this paper, we present a new experiment where we study what data best characterizes each of our student types and explore if this data can be used to predict a student's type early in the course.
1	  To this end, we used machine-learning algorithms to classify student data from one term and predict the students' type on another term.
1	  We identified two sets of relevant features that best describe our types, one containing only performance measurements and another also containing data regarding the students' gaming preferences.
2     Results show that performance alone can be used to predict student type with 79 percent accuracy by midterm.

#### Novel Approach to Facilitating Tradeoff Multi-Objective Grouping Optimization


0	  The grouping problem is critical in collaborative learning (CL) because of the complexity and difficulty in adequate grouping, based on various grouping criteria and numerous learners.
0	  Previous studies have paid attention to certain research questions, and the consideration for a number of learner characteristics has arisen.
0     Such a multi-objective grouping problem is with conflicting grouping objectives, involving the benefit objective (e.g. learning achievement) and cost objective (e.g. class rank) which are conflicting in different directions.
1	  This study first proposed a novel approach based on the enhancement of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) with the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) for facilitating the tradeoff multi-objective grouping optimization, and based on the proposed approach further developed a web-based group support system to help educators for adequate grouping of homogeneous inter-group and heterogeneous intra-group.
1	  In addition, the distribution of learners in the class was considered for group formation.
1	  Two types of experiments were conducted; one involved a performance analysis against a GA and the Random approach, and the other entailed a study on CL with 90 participants.
2     The experimental results showed the following: 1) The proposed approach is not only more effective than a GA and the Random approach but also more efficient than a GA. 2) As a grouping strategy, the proposed approach can facilitate improved learning performance with statistical significance; in other words, the developed system is able to adequately allocate learners to teams for facilitating CL.

#### Don't Be a Stranger-Designing a Digital Intercultural Sensitivity Training Tool that is Culture General


0	  Digital intercultural training tools play an important role in helping people to mediate cultural misunderstandings.
0	  In recent years, these tools were made to teach about specific cultures, but there has been little attention for the design of a tool to teach about differences across a wide range of cultures.
0	  In this work, we take the first steps to create a digital self-contained culture-general training tool.
1	  In the first part of the article, we focus on different aspects and methods of intercultural training.
1     This information is then used in the second part to evaluate the effect of these different methods on the perception of behaviour in misunderstandings.
2     We found that experiential and story-based approaches may lead to different perceptions of participants.
1	  In the third part, we expanded on these critical incidents, and incorporated virtual characters, to evaluate if experiential incidents in an embedded story can lead to an attribution of perceived differences in behaviour to specific differences in culture and to users becoming less judgemental of inappropriate behaviours by people from different cultures.
2     The results suggest that the tool had some effect, but that a debriefing relating the general differences to specific instances would be beneficial.

#### VirTUal remoTe labORatories Management System (TUTORES): Using Cloud Computing to Acquire University Practical Skills


0	  The use of practical laboratories is a key in engineering education in order to provide our students with the resources needed to acquire practical skills.
0	  This is specially true in the case of distance education, where no physical interactions between lecturers and students take place, so virtual or remote laboratories must be used.
1     UNED has developed a system to create and manage virtual remote laboratories, aimed at improving the way how practical exercises are conducted.
1     This system is based on cloud computing and virtualization concepts.
1     These Virtual Remote Laboratories (VRLabs) combine features of traditional virtual and remote laboratories but with clear differences over them, among others, VRLabs do not necessarily access real physical devices but are not based on simulations either.
1     Each student is provided with a virtual remote laboratory based on virtualization that he/she will access through the Internet and will use to implement his/her practical assignments.
1	  We present details on how these laboratories are implemented for a subject in a post-degree program in our University.
2	  Furthermore, we also present an evaluation of the system used on such subject aiming at assessing the quality of the system regarding three different concepts, namely perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and perceived interaction.
2	  This evaluation is twofold, first, we have conducted a survey over the students of the subject, and second, we have performed another survey over the teaching team of the subject, both have been performed for the 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 academic years.

#### An Investigation of a Two-Tier Test Strategy in a University Calculus Course: Causes versus Consequences


0	  Online tests have been identified as a core learning activity in higher education.
0	  Unlike conventional online tests, which cannot completely reflect students' learning status, two-tier tests not only consider students' answers, but also take into account reasons for their answers.
0     Due to such significance, research into the two-tier tests had mushroomed but few studies examined why the two-tier test approach was effective.
1	  To this end, we conducted an empirical study, where a lag sequential analysis was used to analyze behavior patterns while qualitative data from the questionnaire were applied to explain why these behavior patterns were happened.
2     The results indicated students with a two-tier test tended to realize the rationale of a concept, instead of relying on their memories.
2     In other words, the two-tier test can facilitate students to develop deep thinking skills.
2     This may be because they considered the two-tier test as a learning tool, instead of an assessment tool only.

#### Item Response Theory for Peer Assessment


0	  As an assessment method based on a constructivist approach, peer assessment has become popular in recent years.
0	  However, in peer assessment, a problem remains that reliability depends on the rater characteristics.
0     For this reason, some item response models that incorporate rater parameters have been proposed.
0     Those models are expected to improve the reliability if the model parameters can be estimated accurately.
0     However, when applying them to actual peer assessment, the parameter estimation accuracy would be reduced for the following reasons.
0     1) The number of rater parameters increases with two or more times the number of raters because the models include higher-dimensional rater parameters.
0     2) The accuracy of parameter estimation from sparse peer assessment data depends strongly on hand-tuning parameters, called hyperparameters.
1     To solve these problems, this article presents a proposal of a new item response model for peer assessment that incorporates rater parameters to maintain as few rater parameters as possible.
1     Furthermore, this article presents a proposal of a parameter estimation method using a hierarchical Bayes model for the proposed model that can learn the hyperparameters from data.
2     Finally, this article describes the effectiveness of the proposed method using results obtained from a simulation and actual data experiments.

#### Creating Engaging Online Learning Material with the JSAV JavaScript Algorithm Visualization Library


0	  Data Structures and Algorithms are a central part of Computer Science.
0	  Due to their abstract and dynamic nature, they are a difficult topic to learn for many students.
0	  To alleviate these learning difficulties, instructors have turned to algorithm visualizations (AV) and AV systems.
0     Research has shown that especially engaging AVs can have an impact on student learning of DSA topics.
0     Until recently, most AV systems were Java-based systems.
0     But, the popularity of Java has declined and is being supplanted by HTML5 and JavaScript content online.
1     In this paper, we present JSAV: the JavaScript AV development library.
1	  JSAV goes beyond traditional AV library support for displaying standard data structures components, to provide functionality to simplify creation of AVs on many engagement levels including interactive exercises.
2     We describe the growing body of content created with JSAV and summarize our three years of experience and research results from using JSAV to build content that supports CS education.

#### ToothPIC: An Interactive Application for Teaching Oral Anatomy


0	  This paper describes the development and evaluation of an interactive educational program, ToothPlacement and Identification Coach (ToothPIC).
1	  The program uses a game-based learning paradigm and 3D visualization techniques to allow first year dentistry and hygiene students to get familiar with dental anatomy.
2     It provides an interactive and stimulating learning tool for acquiring basic dental skills outside of the classroom.
1	  Specifically, it uses interactive 3D graphics to teach students to identify, name, number, align, and orient teeth into their proper location in the dental arch.
1     ToothPIC incorporates elements of a game to make learning attractive for the student.
1     In the process, the student learns not only about the 3D features of each tooth but also about the proper placement of the tooth relative to the gingiva and other teeth.
1     ToothPIC has two modules: Module 1 includes 32 permanent upper and lower teeth that are to be identified and placed into the surrounding gingiva.
1     Module 2 only shows the individual teeth, one at a time, to be identified (similar to a “flash-card”).
2     The evaluation results of ToothPIC indicate that students strongly agree that program meets its goals of self-training and self-evaluation, actively involves the students in learning and is a useful supplement to laboratory practices and lectures.

#### An Approach Based on Social Network Analysis Applied to a Collaborative Learning Experience


0	  The Social Network Analysis (SNA) techniques allow modelling and analysing the interaction among individuals based on their attributes and relationships.
0	  This approach has been used by several researchers in order to measure the social processes in collaborative learning experiences.
0     But oftentimes such measures were calculated at the final state of experiences, what may be hardly representative of students' behaviours during the learning processes.
0	  Therefore, a temporal dimension in SNA metrics may extend and improve the understanding about students' interactions in a collaborative scenario.
1	  In this respect, this paper presents a systematic review about SNA metrics used for analysing CSCL scenarios and proposes to trace the behaviour of such metrics during experiences through the inclusion of a temporal dimension.
1	  In order to expose this approach, a real collaborative learning experience, supported by a platform called SMLearning System, was analysed.
2     We found that social relationships among students tend to be symmetric, i.e., there was a proportional distribution of efforts and contributions of students, which is an expected condition in a collaborative scenario.
2     Such observations are based on the temporal behaviour of the reciprocity metric and the correlation between in- and out- degree centrality metrics measured in time.

#### A Contextualized System for Supporting Active Learning


0	  The dynamics of the world today demands a change in traditional education paradigms to enable the creation of more efficient learning environments, where students will learn more effectively and will play a more active role in their education.
0	  They should interact with the knowledge at anytime-anywhere.
0	  In order to tackle this problem we should take advantage of mobile communication devices (e.g., smartphones and tablets) which are widely used by students and which have excellent processing storage and connectivity capabilities.
1	  In this research work, a context-aware system stimulating active learning by students was developed.
1	  This system places the student in an intelligent learning environment and is capable of delivering appropriate context-related learning contents, based on location, time, date, interaction of the student, profile of the student, and so on.
1     Within its architecture, the system includes reasoning capability that using context-based ontology is able to deliver efficient learning resources.
2     The experimental results obtained from various learning experiences in nursery, medicine, and systems engineering support the validity of our approach.

#### Flipping the Flipped Classroom: A Study of the Effectiveness of Video Lectures Versus Constructivist Exploration Using Tangible User Interfaces


0	  In this study, we show results that suggest tangible user interfaces (TUIs) may be used to prepare students for future learning.
0     In a previous study, we found that students who used interactive tabletops before studying a text significantly outperformed participants who read a text first and used tabletops subsequently.
0     These findings demonstrate that discovery-learning approaches are better suited to TUIs than traditional “tell-and-practice” approaches.
0	  In our current effort, we generalize our findings to a different population, a different learning material, and a different topic.
1	  In this study, we employ the tangible interface, Combinatorix (Fig.1), which enables small groups of students to work collaboratively and discover concepts in probability.
1	  Our system supports students' explorations of principles in combinatorics (i.e., permutations and combinations) that serve as foundations for learning about probability.
1	  We describe the design of Combinatorix, as well as an experiment that examined the interaction between focused lectures and free exploration.
2	  We found that students who first explored the topic on a tangible interface and then watched a video lecture significantly outperformed students who watched a lecture first and then completed a hands-on activity.
2     We discuss how the “functional fixedness” induced by the video lecture limited the students' learning of probability, and conclude with guidelines for implementing interactive tabletops in classrooms.

#### Virtual Engineering Sciences Learning Lab: Giving STEM Education a Second Life


0	  Engineering education in the 21st century faces multiple obstacles including limited accessibility of course resources due, in part, to the costs associated with acquiring and maintaining equipment and staffing laboratories.
0	  Another continuing challenge is the low level of participation of women and other groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines.
1	  As a partial remedy for these issues, we established a Virtual Engineering Sciences Learning Lab (VESLL) that provides interactive objects and learning activities, multimedia displays, and instant feedback procedures in a virtual environment to guide students through a series of key quantitative skills and concepts.
1     Developed in the online virtual world Second Life™, VESLL is an interactive environment that supports STEM education, with potential to help reach women and other underrepresented groups.
1	  VESLL exposes students to various quantitative skills and concepts through visualization, collaborative games, and problem solving with realistic learning activities.
2     Initial assessments have demonstrated high student interest in VESLL's potential as a supplementary instructional tool and show that student learning experiences were improved by use of VESLL.
2     Ultimately, the VESLL project contributes to the ongoing body of evidence suggesting that online delivery of course content has remarkable potential when properly deployed by STEM educators.

#### Development and Evaluation of an Active Learning Support System for Context-Aware Ubiquitous Learning


0	  Situating students to learn from the real world has been recognized as an important and challenging issue.
0	  However, in a real-world learning environment, there are usually many physical constraints that affect the learning performance of students, such as the total learning time, the limitation of the number of students who can visit a learning target, and the time needed for moving from one learning location to another.
0     It is essential to guide the students along an efficient learning path to maximize their learning performance according to the current situation.
1     In this paper, an active learning support system (ALESS) for context-aware ubiquitous learning environments is designed and developed.
2     ALESS can provide learning guidance when conducting ubiquitous learning activities.
1     A great deal of context information is used in ALESS, including the location, the current capacity of the learning object, the time available, etc.
2     ALESS is able to actively provide the required learning support to individual students when they approach the corresponding real-world learning targets.
1	  To evaluate the performance of ALESS, an experiment was conducted in the National Science Museum of Taiwan.
2     The experimental results showed that, with the help of ALESS, the students learned more efficiently, and achieved better learning performance.

#### Support for Augmented Reality Simulation Systems: The Effects of Scaffolding on Learning Outcomes and Behavior Patterns


0	  An AR-based simulation system that integrates background knowledge and experimental support (AR-SaBEr) was designed as a learning tool for teaching basic principles of electricity to ninth-grade students.
0	  The aim of this study was to investigate how supporting the learner focus on meaningful activities affects behavior and learning performance.
1	  The sample was 82 students, who were randomly assigned to two groups.
1	  The control group used AR-SaBEr with no support for recommending activities.
1	  The experimental group had personalized extra support designed to help learners focus on the subject matters that they did not master.
2     The study found that learners from the experimental group showed better learning achievements than those who participated in the control group.
2     Furthermore, learners' behavioral patterns were dependent upon the support received.
2     Learners from the control group were more willing to browse information about activities than to read about the subject before experimenting.
2     Learners from the experimental group browsed information about prior to carrying them out and read about the subject matter prior to experimentation.
2     The observed behavioral patterns and learning achievements suggest that in augmented reality based simulation environments, it is worth providing mechanisms to focus the attention of students on the most relevant topics for them.

#### Investigating Engagement with In-Video Quiz Questions in a Programming Course


0	  In-video quizzes are common in many distance learning platforms, including those from Coursera and EdX.
0	  However, the effectiveness of in-video quizzes has not previously been assessed.
1	  In this paper, we describe the construction and instrumentation of an Interactive Video Lecture Platform to measure student engagement with in-video quizzes.
1	  We also investigate the use of in-video quizzes as an approach to mitigate the lack of feedback available to students and lecturers in videos and traditional lectures.
1	  Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of augmenting video with the ability to answer and receive feedback to quiz questions embedded directly within the video.
2     We observed that student engagement with in-video questions was consistently high (71-86 percent) across two cohorts ($N_1$= 81,$N_2$= 84) with a rate of one question per 8.7 minutes of video.
2     We identified three broad levels of engagement with the quiz questions and four motivations, including challenge seeking and completionism, which explain some of the observed behaviour.
2     The results from this investigation demonstrate that in-video quizzes were successful in creating an engaging and interactive mode of content delivery.
2     We recommend that in-video quizzes be used to increase the interactivity of video content as well as supporting formative assessment within a flipped classroom environment.

#### Reducing Mistakes in Mathematics Problem Solving through Behavioral Training with a Tablet Computer


0	  This paper proposes a mathematics learning system intended to reduce mistakes in problem solving through behavioral training using a tablet computer.
1	  We focused on the case where students' errors were not due to a lack of knowledge but to a simple mistake.
1     Specifically, we consider the context of traditional assessment methods that feature do-it-again feedback that can focus on the simple mistake, as opposed to conceptual knowledge or logic.
1     The proposed scheme aims to identify and visualize measurable features of behavior that leads to mistakes among students engaged in problem-solving activities.
1	  As a pilot study, we placed students in one of two groups: high-scoring and average-scoring students on a national standardized mathematics test in the Republic of Korea.
1	  Then, using a tablet computer, we collected information on the handwriting and navigation behavior of students during problem solving with millisecond precision and determined its meaningful features.
1	  During the experiments, 15 of the 45 participants were trained on certain features of problem-solving behavior, identified in the pilot study.
1     Three problem-solving assessments were performed, and two training sessions were provided.
2     The results showed that students who trained in problem-solving behaviors achieved an improvement of approximately 14 percent, without additional knowledge training.

1 	To this end, an empirical study was designed with the goal of examining five small groups of students (fifth grade, age 12) who were using mobile devices in authentic educational settings, within a natural science inquiry-based learning activity outdoors.
1 	Second-generation CHAT was operationalized as an analytical and dialectic methodological framework for understanding learning activities mediated by mobile devices.
2 	The study contributes a characterization of mobile learning and identification of constraints and transformations introduced by mobile technology into students' tasks.
